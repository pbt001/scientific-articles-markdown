  abstract = {LaTex is a software system for typesetting documents. Because it is especially good for technical documents and is available for almost any computer system, LaTex has become a lingua franca of the scientific world. Researchers, educators, and students in universities, as well as scientists in industry, use LaTex to produce professionally formatted papers, proposals, and books. They also use LaTex input to communicate information electronically to their colleagues around the world. With the release of LaTex 2[subscript epsilon], the new standard version, LaTex has become even more powerful. Among its new features are an improved method for handling different styles of type, and commands for including graphics and producing colors. LaTex 2[subscript epsilon] makes available to all LaTex users valuable enhancements to the software that have been developed over the years by users in many different places to satisfy a variety of needs. This book, written by the original architect and implementer of LaTex is both the user's guide and the reference manual for the software. It has been updated to reflect the changes in the new release. The book begins with instructions for formatting simpler text, and progressively describes commands and techniques for handling larger and more complicated documents. A separate chapter explains how to deal with errors. An added appendix describes what is new and different in LaTex 2[subscript epsilon]. Other additions to the second edition include descriptions of new commands for inserting pictures prepared with other programs and for producing colored output; new sections on how to make books and slides; instructions for making an index with the MakeIndexprogram, and an updated guide to preparing a bibliography with the BibTex program; plus a section on how to send your LaTex documents electronically. Users new to LaTex will find here a book that has earned worldwide praise as a model for clear, concise, and practical documentation. E},

  abstract = {This study characterizes the usage and acceptance of electronic preprints (e-prints) in the literature of chemistry. Survey of authors of e-prints appearing in the Chemistry Preprint Server (CPS) at http://preprints.chemweb.com indicates use of the CPS as a convenient vehicle for dissemination of research findings and for receipt of feedback before submitting to a peer-reviewed journal. Reception of CPS e-prints by editors of top chemistry journals is very poor. Only 6\% of editors responding allow publication of articles that have previously appeared as e-prints. Concerns focus on the lack of peer review and the uncertain permanence of e-print storage. Consequently, it was not surprising to discover that citation analysis yielded no citations to CPS e-prints in the traditional literature of chemistry. Yet data collected and posted by the CPS indicates that the e-prints are valued, read, and discussed to a notable extent within the chemistry community. Thirty-two percent of the most highly rated, viewed, and discussed e-prints eventually appear in the journal literature, indicating the validity of the work submitted to the CPS. This investigation illustrates the ambivalence with which editors and authors view the CPS, but also gives an early sense of the potential free and rapid information dissemination, coupled with open, uninhibited discussion and evaluation, has to expand, enrich, and vitalize the scholarly discourse of chemical scientists.},

Internet-accessible preprint servers at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), and elsewhere provide unrestricted access to citations and/or full text of many physics and astronomy papers long before they appear in print. Because of the timeliness of these papers, as well as the increasing demand for current research, physicists and astronomers have found it necessary to cite these pre-prints in their research articles rather than wait until they appear in print. This paper identifies the growing importance of electronic preprints in the published literature and addresses several areas of concern regarding the future role of electronic preprints in scientific communication.},

  abstract = {To learn how e-prints are cited, used, and accepted in the literature of physics and astronomy, the philosophies, policies, and practices of top-tier physics and astronomy journals regarding e-prints from the Los Alamos e-print archive, arXiv.org, were examined. Citation analysis illustrated e-prints were cited with increasing frequency by a variety of journals in a wide range of physics and astronomy fields from 1998 to 1999. The peak e-print citation rate of 3 years observed was comparable to that of print journals, suggesting a similarity in citation patterns of e-prints and printed articles. The number of citations made to 37 premier physics and astronomy journals and their impact factors have remained constant since arXiv.org's inception in 1991, indicating that e-prints have yet to make an impact on the use of the printed literature. The degree of acceptance stated by the journals' editors and the policies given in the journal's instructions to authors sections concerning the citing of e-prints and subsequent publication of papers that have appeared as e-prints differed from journal to journal, ranging from emphatically unacceptable to ``why not?'' Even though the use of the traditional literature has not changed since arXiv.org began and the policies concerning e-print citation and publication were inconsistent, the number of citations (35,928) and citations rates (34.1\%) to 12 arXiv.org archives were found to be large and increasing. It is, therefore, evident that arXiv.org e-prints have evolved into an important facet of the scholarly communication of physics and astronomy.},

  abstract = {Software is a critical part of modern research and yet there is little support across the scholarly ecosystem for its acknowledgement and citation. Inspired by the activities of the FORCE11 working group focused on data citation, this document summarizes the recommendations of the FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group and its activities between June 2015 and April 2016. Based on a review of existing community practices, the goal of the working group was to produce a consolidated set of citation principles that may encourage broad adoption of a consistent policy for software citation across disciplines and venues. Our work is presented here as a set of software citation principles, a discussion of the motivations for developing the principles, reviews of existing community practice, and a discussion of the requirements these principles would place upon different stakeholders. Working examples and possible technical solutions for how these principles can be implemented will be discussed in a separate paper.},

  abstract = {Background. Open access (OA) publishing via article processing charges (APCs) is growing as an alternative to subscription publishing. The Pay It Forward (PIF) Project is exploring the feasibility of transitioning from paying subscriptions to funding APCs for faculty at research intensive universities. Estimating of the cost of APCs for the journals authors at research intensive universities tend to publish is essential for the PIF project and similar initiatives. This paper presents our research into this question. Methods. We identified APC prices for publications by authors at the 4 research intensive United States (US) and Canadian universities involved in the study. We also obtained APC payment records from several Western European universities and funding agencies. Both data sets were merged with Web of Science (WoS) metadata. We calculated the average APCs for articles and proceedings in 13 discipline categories published by researchers at research intensive universities. We also identified 41 journals published by traditionally subscription publishers which have recently converted to APC funded OA and recorded the APCs they charge. Results. We identified 7,629 payment records from the 4 European APC payment databases and 14,356 OA articles authored by PIF partner university faculty for which we had listed APC prices. APCs for full OA journals published by PIF authors averaged 1,775 USD; full OA journal APCs paid by Western European funders averaged 1,865 USD; hybrid APCs paid by Western European funders averaged 2,887 USD. The APC for converted journals published by major subscription publishers averaged 1,825 USD. APC funded OA is concentrated in the life and basic sciences. APCs funded articles in the social sciences and humanities are often multidisciplinary and published in journals such as PLOS ONE that largely publish in the life sciences. Conclusions. Full OA journal APCs average a little under 2,000 USD while hybrid articles average about 3,000 USD for publications by researchers at research intensive universities. There is a lack of information on discipline differences in APCs due to the concentration of APC funded publications in a few fields and the multidisciplinary nature of research.},

We take advantage of this revolutionary opportunity when we make our work "open access": digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. Open access is made possible by the Internet and copyright-holder consent, and many authors, musicians, filmmakers, and other creators who depend on royalties are understandably unwilling to give their consent. But for 350 years, scholars have written peer-reviewed journal articles for impact, not for money, and are free to consent to open access without losing revenue. In this concise introduction, Peter Suber tells us what open access is and isn't, how it benefits authors and readers of research, how we pay for it, how it avoids copyright problems, how it has moved from the periphery to the mainstream, and what its future may hold. Distilling a decade of Suber's influential writing and thinking about open access, this is the indispensable book on the subject for researchers, librarians, administrators, funders, publishers, and policy makers.},

                  the nature of reference citations in scientific research
                  articles and other scholarly works, both to other such
                  publications and also to Web information resources, and for
                  publishing these descriptions on the Semantic Web. Citation
                  are described in terms of the factual and rhetorical
                  relationships between citing publication and cited
                  publication, the in-text and global citation frequencies of
                  each cited work, and the nature of the cited work itself,
                  including its publication and peer review status. This paper
                  describes CiTO and illustrates its usefulness both for the
                  annotation of bibliographic reference lists and for the
                  visualization of citation networks. The latest version of
                  CiTO, which this paper describes, is CiTO Version 1.6,

                  to deliver to the user an OWLDoc Web version of the ontology

At its core the value of the ORCID registry is that it crosses disciplines, organizations, and countries, linking ORCID with both existing identifier schemes as well as publications and other research activities. By supporting linkages across multiple datasets – clinical trials, publications, patents, datasets – such a registry becomes a switchboard for researchers and publishers alike in managing the dissemination of research findings. We describe use cases for embedding ORCID identifiers in manuscript submission workflows, prior work searches, manuscript citations, and repository deposition. We make recommendations for storing and displaying ORCID identifiers in publication metadata to include ORCID identifiers, with CrossRef integration as a specific example. Finally, we provide an overview of ORCID membership and integration tools and resources.},

The method results in quantitative transfer of ribosomal proteins from gels containing urea. For sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, the original band pattern was obtained with no loss of resolution, but the transfer was not quantitative. The method allows detection of proteins by autoradiography and is simpler than conventional procedures. The immobilized proteins were detectable by immunological procedures. All additional binding capacity on the nitrocellulose was blocked with excess protein; then a specific antibody was bound and, finally, a second antibody directed against the first antibody. The second antibody was either radioactively labeled or conjugated to fluorescein or to peroxidase. The specific protein was then detected by either autoradiography, under UV light, or by the peroxidase reaction product, respectively. In the latter case, as little as 100 pg of protein was clearly detectable. It is anticipated that the procedure will be applicable to analysis of a wide variety of proteins with specific reactions or ligands.},
