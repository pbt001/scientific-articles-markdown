This is the README file for the LaTeX Article Template for Royal Society of Chemistry Journals.

The zip file contains:

 - rsc_comm.tex (the template with example text)

 - rsc_comm.pdf (an example of the template output PDF)

 - rsc.bib (example bibliography)

 - example.pdf (example figure)

 - head_foot (folder containing header images)

 - rsc.bst (the RSC bibliography style file)

 - packages (folder containing all the packages required by the template)

The following files need to be in the same folder as rsc_comm.tex for the example template to compile correctly:

 - head_foot

 - example.pdf

 - rsc.bib

 - rsc.bst


If you receive an error message from LaTeX that you are missing a necessary package, copy the required file into the same folder as rsc_comm.tex from the packages folder. HOWEVER, please try to compile the template first, as you may already have all the packages installed on your system (or it may install them automatically) and installing duplicate LaTeX packages causes errors.
