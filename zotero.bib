  abstract = {In this era of efficacious antiretroviral therapy and consequent immune reconstitution, oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis (OPC and OEC) still remain two clinically relevant presentations in the global HIV setting. Both diseases are predominantly caused by Candida albicans, a polymorphic fungus which is a commensal microbe in the healthy individual but can become an aggressive pathogen in a debilitated host. Actually, C. albicans commensalism is not the result of a benign behavior of one of the many components of human microbiota, but rather the result of host's potent innate and adaptive immune responses that restrict the growth of a potentially dangerous microrganism on the epithelia. An important asset guarding against the fungus is the Th17 functional subset of T helper cells. The selective loss of these cells with the progression of HIV infection causes the decay of fungal containment on the oral epithelium and allows C. albicans to express its pathogenic potential. An important part of this potential is represented by mechanisms to evade host immunity and enhance inflammation and immunoactivation. In C. albicans, these mechanisms are mostly incorporated into and expressed by characteristic morphogenic transitions such as the yeast-to-hyphal growth and the white-to-opaque switch. In addition, HIV infection generates an `environment' selecting for overexpression of the virulence potential by the fungus, particularly concerning the secreted aspartyl proteinases (Saps). These enzymes can degrade critical host defense components such as complement and epithelial defensive proteins such as histatin-5 and E-cadherin. It appears that part of this enhanced Candida virulence could be induced by the binding of the fungus to HIV and/or induced by HIV proteins such as GP160 and tat. Both OPC and OEC can be controlled by old and new antimycotics, but in the absence of host collaboration, anticandidal therapy may become ineffective in the long run. For these reasons, new therapeutics targeting virulence factors and specific immune interventions are being addressed. Among these new approaches, vaccination is a promising one. Two subunit vaccines based on antigens dominantly expressed by C. albicans in vivo, that is the Als3 adhesin and Sap2, have recently undergone phase 1 clinical trials. Overall, studies of Candida and candidiasis in the HIV-positive patient while certainly contributing to a more effective control of the microorganism may also provide useful information on HIV-host relationship itself that can assist the fight against the virus.

  abstract = {Capsaicinoids, the alkaloids responsible for pungency in chile fruit, are synthesized from phenylpropanoid intermediates and short-chain branched-fatty acids. Transcript levels of enzymes on the capsaicinoid pathway were monitored in Capsicum annuum and C. chinense fruit as a function of development, tissue type and genotype. Clones for Pal, Ca4h, and Comt were isolated from a cDNA library of haba{\~n}ero (C. chinense) placenta. These cDNA clones were used to measure transcript levels in different fruit tissues throughout development in six cultivars differing in pungency. Transcript levels for all three genes were positively correlated with degree of pungency in placental tissue; haba{\~n}ero, the most pungent chile fruit, had the highest transcript levels, CalWonder, a non-pungent fruit, had the lowest levels. Using the transcript accumulation pattern of the phenylpropanoid genes as a screening criterion, other cDNA clones have been selected. Clones for an aminotransferase, predicted to synthesize vanillylamine, and for a 3-keto-acyl ACP synthase, predicted to elongate branched-chain fatty acids, were identified. These genes are expressed in a placental-specific manner, and transcript levels are positively correlated with fruit pungency.},

The presence of defective coffee beans is quite relevant to coffee quality. However, the majority of data on coffee properties are restricted to supposedly good quality beans. Therefore, the present study is aimed at an evaluation of physical and chemical attributes of coffees of different qualities, both green and roasted. Arabica coffee samples, previously classified by cup as soft (higher quality), hard, rioysh and rio (lower quality), were roasted at 200 $^\circ$C for 1 h. Regarding attributes of green coffee beans, both bean density and volume were higher for the soft sample compared to the rio one. The soft sample also presented higher protein levels, due to its higher caffeine contents. The rio sample presented lower lipid contents, probably associated to the presence of defective beans. Acidity increased and pH levels decreased as cup quality decreased, probably due to the effect of defective beans that undergone fermentation (sour beans). After roasting, the rio sample presented higher density and trigonelline levels, indicating that it did not roast to the same degree as the other samples.},

  abstract = {To guarantee sufficient food supply for a growing world population, efforts towards improving crop yield and plant resistance should be complemented with efforts to reduce post-harvest losses. Post-harvest losses are substantial and occur at different stages of the food chain in developed and developing countries. In recent years, a substantially increasing interest can be seen in the application of proteomics to understand post-harvest events. In the near future post-harvest proteomics will be poised to move from fundamental research to aiding the reduction of food losses. Proteomics research can help in reducing food losses through (i) identification and validation of gene products associated to specific quality traits supporting marker-assisted crop improvement programmes, (ii) delivering markers of initial quality that allow optimisation of distribution conditions and prediction of remaining shelf-life for decision support systems and (iii) delivering early detection tools of physiological or pathogen-related post-harvest problems. In this manuscript, recent proteomics studies on post-harvest and stress physiology are reviewed and discussed. Perspectives on future directions of post-harvest proteomics studies aiming to reduce food losses are presented.},

  abstract = {Dendritic cells (DC) are the most important antigen presenting cells and play a pivotal role in host immunity to infectious agents by acting as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Monocyte-derived immature DCs (iDC) were infected with viable resting conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus (Af293) for 12 hours at an MOI of 5; cells were sampled every three hours. RNA was extracted from both organisms at each time point and hybridised to microarrays. iDC cell death increased at 6 h in the presence of A. fumigatus which coincided with fungal germ tube emergence; $>$80\% of conidia were associated with iDC. Over the time course A. fumigatus differentially regulated 210 genes, FunCat analysis indicated significant up-regulation of genes involved in fermentation, drug transport, pathogenesis and response to oxidative stress. Genes related to cytotoxicity were differentially regulated but the gliotoxin biosynthesis genes were down regulated over the time course, while Aspf1 was up-regulated at 9 h and 12 h. There was an up-regulation of genes in the subtelomeric regions of the genome as the interaction progressed. The genes up-regulated by iDC in the presence of A. fumigatus indicated that they were producing a pro-inflammatory response which was consistent with previous transcriptome studies of iDC interacting with A. fumigatus germ tubes. This study shows that A. fumigatus adapts to phagocytosis by iDCs by utilising genes that allow it to survive the interaction rather than just up-regulation of specific virulence genes.},

  abstract = {The major cause of athlete's foot is Trichophyton rubrum, a dermatophyte or fungal pathogen of human skin. To facilitate molecular analyses of the dermatophytes, we sequenced T. rubrum and four related species, Trichophyton tonsurans, Trichophyton equinum, Microsporum canis, and Microsporum gypseum. These species differ in host range, mating, and disease progression. The dermatophyte genomes are highly colinear yet contain gene family expansions not found in other human-associated fungi. Dermatophyte genomes are enriched for gene families containing the LysM domain, which binds chitin and potentially related carbohydrates. These LysM domains differ in sequence from those in other species in regions of the peptide that could affect substrate binding. The dermatophytes also encode novel sets of fungus-specific kinases with unknown specificity, including nonfunctional pseudokinases, which may inhibit phosphorylation by competing for kinase sites within substrates, acting as allosteric effectors, or acting as scaffolds for signaling. The dermatophytes are also enriched for a large number of enzymes that synthesize secondary metabolites, including dermatophyte-specific genes that could synthesize novel compounds. Finally, dermatophytes are enriched in several classes of proteases that are necessary for fungal growth and nutrient acquisition on keratinized tissues. Despite differences in mating ability, genes involved in mating and meiosis are conserved across species, suggesting the possibility of cryptic mating in species where it has not been previously detected. These genome analyses identify gene families that are important to our understanding of how dermatophytes cause chronic infections, how they interact with epithelial cells, and how they respond to the host immune response. IMPORTANCE Athlete's foot, jock itch, ringworm, and nail infections are common fungal infections, all caused by fungi known as dermatophytes (fungi that infect skin). This report presents the genome sequences of Trichophyton rubrum, the most frequent cause of athlete's foot, as well as four other common dermatophytes. Dermatophyte genomes are enriched for four gene classes that may contribute to the ability of these fungi to cause disease. These include (i) proteases secreted to degrade skin; (ii) kinases, including pseudokinases, that are involved in signaling necessary for adapting to skin; (iii) secondary metabolites, compounds that act as toxins or signals in the interactions between fungus and host; and (iv) a class of proteins (LysM) that appear to bind and mask cell wall components and carbohydrates, thus avoiding the host's immune response to the fungi. These genome sequences provide a strong foundation for future work in understanding how dermatophytes cause disease.},

  abstract = {The prenyltransferase (PTase) gene vrtC was proposed to be involved in viridicatumtoxin (1) biosynthesis in Penicillium aethiopicum. Targeted gene deletion and reconstitution of recombinant VrtC activity in vitro established that VrtC is a geranyl transferase that catalyzes a regiospecific Friedel-Crafts alkylation of the naphthacenedione carboxamide intermediate 2 at carbon 6 with geranyl diphosphate. VrtC can function in the absence of divalent ions and can utilize similar naphthacenedione substrates, such as the acetyl-primed TAN-1612 (4). Genome mining using the VrtC protein sequence leads to the identification of a homologous group of PTase genes in the genomes of human and animal-associated fungi. Three enzymes encoded by this new subgroup of PTase genes from Neosartorya fischeri, Microsporum can is, and Trichophyton tonsurans were shown to be able to catalyze transfer of dimethylallyl to several tetracyclic naphthacenedione substrates in vitro. In total, seven C-5- or C-10-prenylated naphthacenedione compounds were generated. The regioselectivity of these new polycyclic PTases (pcPTases) was confirmed by characterization of product 9 obtained from biotransformation of 4 in Escherichia coli expressing the N. fischeri pcPTase gene. The discovery of this new subgroup of PTases extends our enzymatic tools for modifying polycyclic compounds and enables genome mining of new prenylated polyketides.},

However, the peptide-centric nature of shotgun proteomics complicates the analysis and biological interpretation of the data especially in the case of higher eukaryote organisms. The same peptide sequence can be present in multiple different proteins or protein isoforms. Such shared peptides therefore can lead to ambiguities in determining the identities of sample proteins. In this article we illustrate the difficulties of interpreting shotgun proteomic data and discuss the need for common nomenclature and transparent informatic approaches. We also discuss related issues such as the state of protein sequence databases and their role in shotgun proteomic analysis, interpretation of relative peptide quantification data in the presence of multiple protein isoforms, the integration of proteomic and transcriptional data, and the development of a computational infrastructure for the integration of multiple diverse datasets.},

It has also emerged as a potential feedstock and model system for bioenergy research due to recent worldwide interest in developing plant biomass-based, carbon-neutral liquid fuels. To understand how the underlying genome sequence results in specific plant phenotypes, information on the temporal and spatial transcription patterns of genes is crucial. Here we present a comprehensive atlas of global transcription profiles across developmental stages and plant organs. We used a NimbleGen microarray containing 80,301 probe sets to profile transcription patterns in 60 distinct tissues representing 11 major organ systems of inbred line B73. Of the 30,892 probe sets representing the filtered B73 gene models, 91.4\% were expressed in at least one tissue. Interestingly, 44.5\% of the probe sets were expressed in all tissues, indicating a substantial overlap of gene expression among plant organs. Clustering of maize tissues based on global gene expression profiles resulted in formation of groups of biologically related tissues. We utilized this dataset to examine the expression of genes that encode enzymes in the lignin biosynthetic pathway, and found that expansion of distinct gene families was accompanied by divergent, tissue-specific transcription patterns of the paralogs. This comprehensive expression atlas represents a valuable resource for gene discovery and functional characterization in maize.},

A specific tool is available for isotopic pattern modeling to enable precise data validation. The largest available lipid database (from the LIPID MAPS Consortium) has been incorporated and together with the new compound search tool lipids can be rapidly identified. In addition, the user can define custom libraries of compounds and use them analogously. The new version of mMass is based on a stand-alone Python library, which provides the basic functionality for data processing and interpretation. This library can serve as a good starting point for other developers in their projects. Binary distributions of mMass, its source code, a detailed user's guide, and video tutorials are freely available from www.mmass.org .},

It allows one to calculate ultrahigh resolution isotope distributions on computers having limited memory resources and incudes a peak-shape function as an inherent part of the calculation. The method zooms-in on a limited mass range and uses digital filtering to reduce the required array size for the calculation. Alternative methods typically have very unfavorable scaling properties as molecular weight increases, making them unsuitable for this application. At present, the method is probably the only practicable way to calculate ultrahigh resolution isotope distributions of very large molecules using computers having limited memory resources.},

  abstract = {Glyoxalase I is part of the glyoxalase system present in the cytosol of cells. The glyoxalase system catalyses the conversion of reactive, acyclic alpha-oxoaldehydes into the corresponding alpha-hydroxyacids. Glyoxalase I catalyses the isomerization of the hemithioacetal, formed spontaneously from alpha-oxoaldehyde and GSH, to S -2-hydroxyacylglutathione derivatives [RCOCH(OH)-SG--$>$RCH(OH)CO-SG], and in so doing decreases the steady-state concentrations of physiological alpha-oxoaldehydes and associated glycation reactions. Physiological substrates of glyoxalase I are methylglyoxal, glyoxal and other acyclic alpha-oxoaldehydes. Human glyoxalase I is a dimeric Zn(2+) metalloenzyme of molecular mass 42 kDa. Glyoxalase I from Escherichia coli is a Ni(2+) metalloenzyme. The crystal structures of human and E. coli glyoxalase I have been determined to 1.7 and 1.5 A resolution. The Zn(2+) site comprises two structurally equivalent residues from each domain--Gln-33A, Glu-99A, His-126B, Glu-172B and two water molecules. The Ni(2+) binding site comprises His-5A, Glu-56A, His-74B, Glu-122B and two water molecules. The catalytic reaction involves base-catalysed shielded-proton transfer from C-1 to C-2 of the hemithioacetal to form an ene-diol intermediate and rapid ketonization to the thioester product. R - and S-enantiomers of the hemithioacetal are bound in the active site, displacing the water molecules in the metal ion primary co-ordination shell. It has been proposed that Glu-172 is the catalytic base for the S-substrate enantiomer and Glu-99 the catalytic base for the R-substrate enantiomer; Glu-172 then reprotonates the ene-diol stereospecifically to form the R-2-hydroxyacylglutathione product. By analogy with the human enzyme, Glu-56 and Glu-122 may be the bases involved in the catalytic mechanism of E. coli glyoxalase I. The suppression of alpha-oxoaldehyde-mediated glycation by glyoxalase I is particularly important in diabetes and uraemia, where alpha-oxoaldehyde concentrations are increased. Decreased glyoxalase I activity in situ due to the aging process and oxidative stress results in increased glycation and tissue damage. Inhibition of glyoxalase I pharmacologically with specific inhibitors leads to the accumulation of alpha-oxoaldehydes to cytotoxic levels; cell-permeable glyoxalase I inhibitors are antitumour and antimalarial agents. Glyoxalase I has a critical role in the prevention of glycation reactions mediated by methylglyoxal, glyoxal and other alpha-oxoaldehydes in vivo.},

Here we demonstrate data reduction tools, based on automated feature identification and extraction, for peptide, protein, and lipid imaging MS, using multiple imaging MS technologies, that reduce data loads and the number of variables by \&gt;100\texttimes, and that highlight highly-localized features that can be missed using standard data analysis strategies.

  abstract = {Capsaicin, the pungent principle in hot peppers, acts to deter mammals from consuming pungent pepper pods. Capsaicinoid biosynthesis is restricted to the genus Capsicum and results from the acylation of the aromatic compound, vanillylamine, with a branched-chain fatty acid. The presence of capsaicinoids is controlled by the Pun1 locus, which encodes a putative acyltransferase. In its homozygous recessive state, pun1/pun1, capsaicinoids are not produced by the pepper plant. HPLC analysis confirmed that capsaicinoids are only found in the interlocular septa of pungent pepper fruits. Immunolocalization studies showed that capsaicinoid biosynthesis is uniformly distributed across the epidermal cells of the interlocular septum. Capsaicinoids are secreted from glandular epidermal cells into subcuticular cavities that swell to form blisters along the epidermis. Blister development is positively associated with capsaicinoid accumulation and blisters are not present in non-pungent fruit. A genetic study was used to determine if the absence of blisters in non-pungent fruit acts independently of Pun1 to control pungency. Screening of non-pungent germplasm and genetic complementation tests identified a previously unknown recessive allele of Pun1, named pun1(2). Sequence analysis of pun1(2) revealed that a four base pair deletion results in a frameshift mutation and the predicted production of a truncated protein. Genetic analysis revealed that pun1(2) co-segregated exactly with the absence of blisters, non-pungency, and a reduced transcript accumulation of several genes involved in capsaicinoid biosynthesis. Collectively, these results establish that blister formation requires the Pun1 allele and that pun1(2) is a recessive allele from C. chinense that results in non-pungency.},

  abstract = {Oral infections with Candida albicans are very common diseases in even only mildly immunocompromised patients. By using genome-wide microarrays, in vitro infection models and samples from patients with pseudomembranous candidiasis, several genes have been identified which encode known and unknown fungal factors associated with oral infection. The expression of selected genes has been investigated via qRT-PCR in both in vitro models and in vivo samples from patients. Several lines of evidence suggest that fungal morphology plays a key role in adhesion to and invasion into oral epithelial cells and mutants lacking regulators of hyphal formation are attenuated in their ability to invade and damage epithelial cells. Adhesion is mediated by hyphal-associated factors such as Hwp1 and the Als adhesin family. Hyphal formation facilitates epithelial invasion via two routes: active penetration and induced endocytosis. While induced endocytosis is predominantly mediated by the adhesin and invasin Als3, active penetration seems to be supported by hydrolase activity and mechanical pressure. Expression profiles reflect the morphological switch and an adaptive response to neutral pH, non-glucose carbon sources, and nitrosative stress. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Shotgun proteomics provides the most powerful analytical platform for global inventory of complex proteomes using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and allows a global analysis of protein changes. Nevertheless, sampling of complex proteomes by current shotgun proteomics platforms is incomplete, and this contributes to variability in assessment of peptide and protein inventories by spectral counting approaches. Thus, shotgun proteomics data pose challenges in comparing proteomes from different biological states. We developed an analysis strategy using quasi-likelihood Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM), included in a graphical interface software package (Quasi-Tel) that reads standard output from protein assemblies created by IDPicker, an HTML-based user interface to query shotgun proteomic data sets. This approach was compared to four other statistical analysis strategies: Student t test, Wilcoxon rank test, Fisher's Exact test, and Poisson-based GLM. We analyzed the performance of these tests to identify differences in protein levels based on spectral counts in a shotgun data set in which equimolar amounts of 48 human proteins were spiked at different levels into whole yeast lysates. Both GLM approaches and the Fisher Exact test performed adequately, each with their unique limitations. We subsequently compared the proteomes of normal tonsil epithelium and HNSCC using this approach and identified 86 proteins with differential spectral counts between normal tonsil epithelium and HNSCC. We selected 18 proteins from this comparison for verification of protein levels between the individual normal and tumor tissues using liquid chromatography- multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS). This analysis confirmed the magnitude and direction of the protein expression differences in all 6 proteins for which reliable data could be obtained. Our analysis demonstrates that shotgun proteomic data sets from different tissue phenotypes are sufficiently rich in quantitative information and that statistically significant differences in proteins spectral counts reflect the underlying biology of the samples.},

ApoEdpL-W was active against planktonic cells and early-stage biofilms but less active against mature biofilms, possibly because of its affinity for extracellular matrix beta-glucans. Moreover, ApoEdpL-W absorbed to medically relevant materials partially prevented the formation of biofilms on these materials. The exposure of C. albicans cells to sublethal doses of ApoEdpL-W triggered a transcriptional response reminiscent of that associated with the inactivation of the MYO5 gene required for endocytosis as well as the upregulation of amino acid transporter genes. A fluorescent derivative of ApoEdpL-W accumulated at the cytoplasmic membrane and subsequently was translocated to the vacuole. Strikingly, the inactivation of MYO5 or addition of latrunculin, an inhibitor of endocytosis, prevented the vacuolar accumulation of fluorescein-labeled ApoEdpL-W and reduced the antifungal activity of ApoEdpL-W. This, together with the insensitivity of ApoEdpL-W to alterations in membrane fluidity and high salt, suggested that the ApoEdpL-W mode of action was dependent upon vacuolar targeting and differed significantly from that of other antifungal peptides, such as Histatin-5 and Magainin 2.},

Altogether 30 different basidiomycetes were grown submerged in liquid culture media using seven different by-products of the food industry as the only carbon source.

Potent odorants were identified by aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA), calculation of the odour activity values (OAV), and proven by confection of an aroma model. 3-Phenylpropanal, 3-phenyl-1-propanol, and benzyl alcohol were identified as potent aroma biotransformation products. Headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME\textendash{}GC\textendash{}MS) experiments showed that 3-phenylpropanal, 3-phenyl-1-propanol, benzyl alcohol, methyl 3-phenylpropionate, methyl 2-phenylacetate, cinnamaldehyde and methyl cinnamate were produced during the cultivation period of eight days. By means of labelling experiments, (E)-cinnamic acid was identified as the precursor of 3-phenylpropanal and 3-phenyl-1-propanol.

The majority of these mycoses are caused by dermatophytes, a specialized group of filamentous fungi that exclusively infect keratinized host structures. Despite the high prevalence of the disease, dermatophytosis, little is known about the pathogenicity mechanisms of these microorganisms. This drawback may be related to the fact that dermatophytes have been investigated poorly at the molecular level. In contrast to many other pathogenic fungi, they grow comparatively slowly under in vitro conditions, and in the last decades, only a limited number of molecular tools have been established for their manipulation. In recent years, however, major promising approaches were undertaken to improve genetic analyses in dermatophytes. These strategies include efficient systems for targeted gene inactivation and gene silencing, and broad transcriptional profiling techniques, which have even been applied in sophisticated infection models. As a fundamental prerequisite for future genetic analyses, full genome sequences of seven different dermatophyte species have become available recently. Therefore, it appeared timely to review the available molecular tools and methodologies in dermatophyte research, which may provide future insights into the virulence of these clinically important pathogens.},

  abstract = {The nonheme di-iron oxygenase, AurF, converts p-aminobenzoate (Ar-NH(2), where Ar = 4-carboxyphenyl) to p-nitrobenzoate (Ar-NO(2)) in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic, aureothin, by Streptomyces thioluteus. It has been reported that this net six-electron oxidation proceeds in three consecutive, two-electron steps, through p-hydroxylaminobenzoate (Ar-NHOH) and p-nitrosobenzoate (Ar-NO) intermediates, with each step requiring one equivalent of O(2) and two exogenous reducing equivalents. We recently demonstrated that a peroxodiiron(III/III) complex (peroxo-Fe(2)(III/III)-AurF) formed by addition of O(2) to the diiron(II/II) enzyme (Fe(2)(II/II)-AurF) effects the initial oxidation of Ar-NH(2), generating a mu-(oxo)diiron (III/III) form of the enzyme (mu-oxo-Fe(2)(III/III)-AurF) and (presumably) Ar-NHOH. Here we show that peroxo-Fe(2)(III/III)-AurF also oxidizes Ar-NHOH. Unexpectedly, this reaction proceeds through to the Ar-NO(2) final product, a four-electron oxidation, and produces Fe(2)(II/II)-AurF, with which O(2) can combine to regenerate peroxo-Fe(2)(III/III)-AurF. Thus, conversion of Ar-NHOH to Ar-NO(2) requires only a single equivalent of O(2) and (starting from Fe(2)(II/II)-AurF or peroxo-Fe(2)(III/III)-AurF) is fully catalytic in the absence of exogenous reducing equivalents, by contrast to the published stoichiometry. This novel type of four-electron N-oxidation is likely also to occur in the reaction sequences of nitro-installing di-iron amine oxygenases in the biosyntheses of other natural products.},

  abstract = {Coffee grown at high elevations fetches a better price than that grown in lowland regions. This study was aimed at determining whether climatic conditions during bean development affected sensory perception of the coffee beverage and combinations of volatile compounds in green coffee. Green coffee samples from 16 plots representative of the broad range of climatic variations in R{\'e}union Island were compared by sensory analysis. Volatiles were extracted by solid phase micro-extraction and the volatile compounds were analysed by GC-MS. The results revealed that, among the climatic factors, the mean air temperature during seed development greatly influenced the sensory profile. Positive quality attributes such as acidity, fruity character and flavour quality were correlated and typical of coffees produced at cool climates. Two volatile compounds (ethanal and acetone) were identified as indicators of these cool temperatures. Among detected volatiles, most of the alcohols, aldehydes, hydrocarbons and ketones appeared to be positively linked to elevated temperatures and high solar radiation, while the sensory profiles displayed major defects (i.e. green, earthy flavour). Two alcohols (butan-1,3-diol and butan-2,3-diol) were closely correlated with a reduction in aromatic quality, acidity and an increase in earthy and green flavours. We assumed that high temperatures induce accumulation of these compounds in green coffee, and would be detected as off-flavours, even after roasting. Climate change, which generally involves a substantial increase in average temperatures in mountainous tropical regions, could be expected to have a negative impact on coffee quality.},

The need for long time-domain transients, and thus large raw file sizes, results in a large amount of raw data (``big data'') that must be processed efficiently and rapidly. This can be compounded by large-area imaging and/or high spatial resolution imaging. For FT-ICR, data processing and data reduction must not compromise the high mass resolution afforded by the mass spectrometer. The continuous mode ``Mosaic Datacube'' approach allows high mass resolution visualization (0.001 Da) of mass spectrometry imaging data, but requires additional processing as compared to feature-based processing. We describe the use of distributed computing for processing of FT-ICR MS imaging datasets with generation of continuous mode Mosaic Datacubes for high mass resolution visualization. An eight-fold improvement in processing time is demonstrated using a Dutch nationally available cloud service. Graphical abstract ᅟ},

  shorttitle = {Ancillary Study Management Systems},
  doi = {10.1186/1472-6947-13-5},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The valuable clinical data, specimens, and assay results collected during a primary clinical trial or observational study can enable researchers to answer additional, pressing questions with relatively small investments in new measurements. However, management of such follow-on, "ancillary" studies is complex. It requires coordinating across institutions, sites, repositories, and approval boards, as well as distributing, integrating, and analyzing diverse data types. General-purpose software systems that simplify the management of ancillary studies have not yet been explored in the research literature.
METHODS: We have identified requirements for ancillary study management primarily as part of our ongoing work with a number of large research consortia. These organizations include the Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI), the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the U.S. Military HIV Research Program (MHRP), and the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes (nPOD). We also consulted with researchers at a range of other disease research organizations regarding their workflows and data management strategies. Lastly, to enhance breadth, we reviewed process documents for ancillary study management from other organizations.
RESULTS: By exploring characteristics of ancillary studies, we identify differentiating requirements and scenarios for ancillary study management systems (ASMSs). Distinguishing characteristics of ancillary studies may include the collection of additional measurements (particularly new analyses of existing specimens); the initiation of studies by investigators unaffiliated with the original study; cross-protocol data pooling and analysis; pre-existing participant consent; and pre-existing data context and provenance. For an ASMS to address these characteristics, it would need to address both operational requirements (e.g., allocating existing specimens) and data management requirements (e.g., securely distributing and integrating primary and ancillary data).
CONCLUSIONS: The scenarios and requirements we describe can help guide the development of systems that make conducting ancillary studies easier, less expensive, and less error-prone. Given the relatively consistent characteristics and challenges of ancillary study management, general-purpose ASMSs are likely to be useful to a wide range of organizations. Using the requirements identified in this paper, we are currently developing an open-source, general-purpose ASMS based on LabKey Server (http://www.labkey.org) in collaboration with CHAVI, the ITN and nPOD.},

  abstract = {Since 2008, Brazil has become the largest consumer of pesticides worldwide. This development follows four decades of governmental investments aimed at modernizing Brazilian agriculture. An unintended consequence of pesticide consumption has been the steady growth of human health problems and environmental contamination. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of how pesticides are routinely handled by smallholders in a tropical region of the Rio de Janeiro state and the potential environmental post-application fate based on chemical product characteristics. While our results do not confirm that the farmers' apparent careless handling of pesticides is linked to an intentional disregard for intoxication risk, they do point to a more complex set of explanatory variables that include: labor scarcity, inadequacy of protective gear, mixing practices, and limited educational effectiveness of labeling standards. Mixing practices may be increasing the risk to human health and to the environment, especially given the toxicity levels of the fifteen active ingredients identified in this study. For ten of the commercially used pesticides identified we suggest further study. These chemicals can potentially contaminate groundwater through leaching and run-off due to their physicochemical characteristics which facilitate their mobility in the soil layers. Given the large consumption of pesticides in Brazil and the risks listed herein, we find urgent to address legislation, labeling, training and other measures that would provide incentives to reduce intoxication risks to both Brazilian farmers and the environment.},

Soxhlet and microwave-assisted techniques were used to extract nicotine from cigar fillers of varying moisture contents (5\textendash{}20\%), using a polar (methanol) and a non-polar (isooctane) solvent. The extracts were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame-ionization detector. For both extraction techniques, higher nicotine yields were consistently obtained with methanol than with isooctane from the same samples. Solubility of nicotine salts in methanol but not in isooctane is the major cause of this observation. Moreover, pronounced effects of the tobacco moisture content on extraction efficiency were observed with isooctane but not with methanol. For microwave assisted extraction (MAE) with isooctane, nicotine yield increased from 3 to 70\% as the moisture level in tobacco was raised from 3 to 13\%, and leveled off thereafter. Similar observations were made with Soxhlet extraction. While MAE results were rationalized by the known cell-rupture process, a mechanism based on the interaction between the solvents and the structural components of the plant cells has been proposed to account for the observations made with Soxhlet extraction.},

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of various cellular responses to environmental changes in eukaryotes. Genome Blast analysis revealed that the central core of the cell wall integrity signaling pathway in A. fumigatus is composed of three protein kinases designated Bck1, Mkk2 and MpkA. This pathway is of particular interest because it represents a possible target for new antifungal drugs. Deletion of these genes resulted in severe sensitivity of the mutants against cell wall-disturbing compounds and drastic alterations of the fungal morphology. Western blot analysis demonstrated that Bck1 and Mkk2 directly activate MpkA during vegetative growth and under cell wall stress conditions further confirming that Bck1, Mkk2 and MpkA form a MAP kinase module. Interestingly, this MAP kinase module affects the formation of pyomelanin derived from tyrosine degradation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: Legionella pneumophila is a pathogenic bacterium that can cause Legionnaires' disease and other non-pneumonic infections in humans. This bacterium produces a pyomelanin pigment, a potential virulence factor with ferric reductase activity. In this work, we have investigated the role of phenylalanine hydroxylase from L. pneumophila (lpPAH), the product of the phhA gene, in the synthesis of the pyomelanin pigment and the growth of the bacterium in defined compositions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Comparative studies of wild-type and phhA mutant corroborate that lpPAH provides the excess tyrosine for pigment synthesis. phhA and letA (gacA) appear transcriptionally linked when bacteria were grown in buffered yeast extract medium at 37 degrees C. phhA is expressed in L. pneumophila growing in macrophages. We also cloned and characterized lpPAH, which showed many characteristics of other PAHs studied so far, including Fe(II) requirement for activity. However, it also showed many particular properties such as dimerization, a high conformational thermal stability, with a midpoint denaturation temperature (T-m) = 79 +/- 0.5 degrees C, a high specific activity at 37 degrees C (10.2 +/- 0.3 mu mol L-Tyr/mg/min) and low affinity for the substrate (K-m (L-Phe) = 735 +/- 50 mu M. Conclusions/Significance: lpPAH has a major functional role in the synthesis of pyomelanin and promotes growth in low-tyrosine media. The high thermal stability of lpPAH might reflect the adaptation of the enzyme to withstand relatively high survival temperatures.},

While the core gene cluster coding for the functionalities required for the biosynthesis of the basic structure aurachin D is known, neither of the genes encoding for the successively acting tailoring enzymes was known up to date, which was assumed to be due to a split cluster organisation. Here we describe the identification of a total of five genes, located upstream of the aurachin core cluster and at additional two loci elsewhere in the genome, encoding for the aforementioned functionalities. The generation and evaluation of respective inactivation mutants of S. aurantiaca Sg a15 allowed for the first time to propose an exhaustive model for aurachin biosynthesis.

The mass spectrometer consists of a newly designed electrospray ion-source that is plugged directly into a modified commercial quadrupole mass spectrometer with the ions entering the mass analyzer through a long metal capillary tube and three stages of differential pumping. The present ion source differs from previous designs in the combination of techniques employed in the transportation and desolvation of solvated biomolecule ions, prior to mass analysis. Transport of ionized entities between atmospheric pressure and vacuum is carried out through a 203 mm long stainless steel capillary tube with a 0.5 mm bore. Desolvation is effected by the use of controlled heat transfer through the long capillary tube and collisional activation in a region of reduced pressure between the capillary tube exit and the skimmer. Desolvation with this system is convenient and effective and does not involve the strong countercurrent flows of gases that have been used by all previous workers. The effects on the spectra of peptides of capillary tube temperature and desolvation collision energy are investigated. Electrospray-ionization mass spectrometric results are described for thirteen proteins with molecular masses ranging from 5000 to 77,000 Da. The performance of the present instrument, with respect to mass accuracy and sensitivity, is comparable with previously reported systems. The effect of protein concentration in solution on the electrospray mass spectrometric response and charge-state distribution is discussed.},

  abstract = {The occurrence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) remains a major problem in intensive care units with high morbidity and mortality. The differentiation between noninfectious and infectious etiologies of this disorder is challenging in routine clinical practice. Many biomarkers have been suggested for this purpose; however, sensitivity and specificity even of high-ranking biomarkers remain insufficient. Recently, metabolic profiling has attracted interest for biomarker discovery. The objective of this study was to identify metabolic biomarkers for differentiation of SIRS/sepsis. A total of 186 metabolites comprising six analyte classes were determined in 143 patients (74 SIRS, 69 sepsis) by LC-MS/MS. Two markers (C10:1 and PCaaC32:0) revealed significantly higher concentrations in sepsis. A classification model comprising these markers resulted in 80\% and 70\% correct classifications in a training set and a test set, respectively.(Jlr) This study demonstrates that acylcarnitines and glycerophosphatidylcholines may be helpful for differentiation of infectious from noninfectious systemic inflammation due to their significantly higher concentration in sepsis patients. Considering the well known pathophysiological relevance of lipid induction by bacterial components, metabolites as identified in this study are promising biomarker candidates in the differential diagnosis of SIRS and sepsis.-Schmerler, D., S.

The capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway has been established, but the enzymes and genes participating in this process have not been extensively studied or characterized. Capsaicinoids are synthesized through the convergence of two biosynthetic pathways: the phenylpropanoid and the branched-chain fatty acid pathways, which provide the precursors phenylalanine, and valine or leucine, respectively. Capsaicinoid biosynthesis and accumulation is a genetically determined trait in chili pepper fruits as different cultivars or genotypes exhibit differences in pungency; furthermore, this characteristic is also developmentally and environmentally regulated. The establishment of cDNA libraries and comparative gene expression studies in pungent and non-pungent chili pepper fruits has identified candidate genes possibly involved in capsaicinoid biosynthesis. Genetic and molecular approaches have also contributed to the knowledge of this biosynthetic pathway; however, more studies are necessary for a better understanding of the regulatory process that accounts for different accumulation levels of capsaicinoids in chili pepper fruits.},

  abstract = {The genetically tractable endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica is able to colonize the root cortex of a great variety of different plant species with beneficial effects to its hosts, and it represents a suitable model system to study symbiotic interactions. Recent cytological studies in barley and Arabidopsis showed that, upon penetration of the root, P. indica establishes a biotrophic interaction during which fungal cells are encased by the host plasma membrane. Large-scale transcriptional analyses of fungal and plant responses have shown that perturbance of plant hormone homeostasis and secretion of fungal lectins and other small proteins (effectors) may be involved in the evasion and suppression of host defenses at these early colonization steps. At later stages, P. indica is found more often in moribund host cells where it secretes a large variety of hydrolytic enzymes that degrade proteins. This strategy of colonizing plants is reminiscent of that of hemibiotrophic fungi, although a defined shift to necrotrophy with massive host cell death is missing. Instead, the association with the plant root leads to beneficial effects for the host such as growth promotion, increased resistance to root as well as leaf pathogens, and increased tolerance to abiotic stresses. This review describes current advances in understanding the components of the P. indica endophytic lifestyle from molecular and genomic analyses.},

The data sets consist of a large number of mass spectra which are usually acquired with identical settings. Existing data formats are not sufficient to describe an MS imaging experiment completely. The data format imzML was developed to allow the flexible and efficient exchange of MS imaging data between different instruments and data analysis software.For this purpose, the MS imaging data is divided in two separate files. The mass spectral data is stored in a binary file to ensure efficient storage. All metadata (e.g., instrumental parameters, sample details) are stored in an XML file which is based on the standard data format mzML developed by HUPO-PSI. The original mzML controlled vocabulary was extended to include specific parameters of imaging mass spectrometry (such as x/y position and spatial resolution). The two files (XML and binary) are connected by offset values in the XML file and are unambiguously linked by a universally unique identifier. The resulting datasets are comparable in size to the raw data and the separate metadata file allows flexible handling of large datasets.Several imaging MS software tools already support imzML. This allows choosing from a (growing) number of processing tools. One is no longer limited to proprietary software, but is able to use the processing software which is best suited for a specific question or application. On the other hand, measurements from different instruments can be compared within one software application using identical settings for data processing. All necessary information for evaluating and implementing imzML can be found at http://www.imzML.org .},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0009036},
  abstract = {Background: Aspergillus fumigatus is associated with both invasive and allergic pulmonary diseases, in different hosts. The organism is inhaled as a spore, which, if not cleared from the airway, germinates into hyphal morphotypes that are responsible for tissue invasion and resultant inflammation. Hyphae secrete multiple products that function as antigens, evoking both a protective (T(H)1-T(H)17) and destructive allergic (T(H)2) immunity. How Aspergillus allergens (Asp f proteins) participate in the development of allergic sensitization is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: To determine whether Asp f proteins are strictly associated with T(H)2 responses, or represent soluble hyphal products recognized by healthy hosts, human T cell responses to crude and recombinant products were characterized by ELISPOT. While responses (number of spots producing IFN-gamma, IL-4 or IL-17) to crude hyphal antigen preparations were weak, responses to recombinant Asp f proteins were higher. Recombinant allergens stimulated cells to produce IFN-gamma more so than IL-4 or IL-17. Volunteers exhibited a diverse CD4+ and CD8+ T cell antigen recognition profile, with prominent CD4 T(H)1-responses to Asp f3 (a putative peroxismal membrane protein), Asp f9/16 (cell wall glucanase), Asp f11 (cyclophilin type peptidyl-prolyl isomerase) and Asp f22 (enolase). Strong IFN-gamma responses were reproduced in most subjects tested over 6 month intervals. Conclusions: Products secreted after conidial germination into hyphae are differentially recognized by protective T cells in healthy, non-atopic individuals. Defining the specificity of the human T cell repertoire, and identifying factors that govern early responses may allow for development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics for both invasive and allergic Aspergillus diseases.},

  doi = {10.1002/mas.20339},
  abstract = {Although access to high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS), especially in the field of biomolecular MS, is becoming readily available due to recent advances in MS technology, the accompanied information on isotopic distribution in high-resolution spectra is not used at its full potential, mainly because of lack of knowledge and/or awareness. In this review, we give an insight into the practical problems related to calculating the isotopic distribution for large biomolecules, and present an overview of methods for the calculation of the isotopic distribution. We discuss the key events that triggered the development of various algorithms and explain the rationale of how and why the various isotopic-distribution calculations were performed. The review is focused around the developmental stages as briefly outlined below, starting with the first observation of an isotopic distribution. The observations of Beynon in the field of organic MS that chlorine appeared in a mass spectrum as two variants with odds 3:1 lie at the basis of the first wave of algorithms for the calculation of the isotopic distribution, based on the atomic composition of a molecule. From here on, we explain why more complex biomolecules such as peptides exhibit a highly complex isotope pattern when assayed by MS, and we discuss how combinatorial difficulties complicate the calculation of the isotopic distribution on computers. For this purpose, we highlight three methods, which were introduced in the 1980s. These are the stepwise procedure introduced by Kubinyi, the polynomial expansion from Brownawell and Fillippo, and the multinomial expansion from Yergey. The next development was instigated by Rockwood, who suggested to decompose the isotopic distribution in terms of their nucleon count instead of the exact mass. In this respect, we could claim that the term "aggregated" isotopic distribution is more appropriate. Due to the simplification of the isotopic distribution to its aggregated counterpart, Rockwood was able to use the convolution for the calculation of the "aggregated" isotopic distribution. Convolution methods are computationally efficient and economic in their memory usage. We spend a section on the work introduced by Rockwood during the 1990s. Due to recent breakthroughs in mass spectrometric technology and the widespread high-resolution instruments (e.g., FTICR-MS, FTOrbitrap-MS, and TOF-MS) that provide high-resolution, isotope-resolved, accurate mass data, there is an emerging need for algorithms that can calculate isotopic distributions for large biomolecules. The number of recent publications on this topic does witness this trend. The new methods are mostly based on complex mathematical developments such as, for example, cellular automata (Meija and Caruso [2004]. J Am Soc Mass Spectrom, 15(5):654-658), dynamic programming (Snider [2007]. J Am Soc Mass Spectrom, 18:1511-1515), and hierarchical models (Li et al. [2008] J Am Soc Mass Spectrom, 19:1867-1874). We also comment on the ideas to use Punnet squares and Pascal's triangle to introduce the concept of the isotopic distribution for educational and didactic purposes.},

Materials and Methods: SET protein was analyzed in 372 HNSCC tissue samples by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarray and HNSCC cell lineages. Oxidative stress was induced with the pro-oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide (50 and 250 mu M) in the HNSCC HN13 cell lineage either with (siSET) or without (siNC) SET knockdown. Cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion and annexin V/propidium iodide assays. It was assessed caspase-3 and -9, PARP-1, DNA fragmentation, NM23-H1, SET, Akt and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) status. Acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) were assessed by the acridine orange assay. Glutathione levels and transcripts of antioxidant genes were assayed by fluorometry and real time PCR, respectively. Results: SET levels were up-regulated in 97\% tumor tissue samples and in HNSCC cell lineages. SiSET in HN13 cells (i) promoted cell death but did not induced caspases, PARP-1 cleavage or DNA fragmentation, and (ii) decreased resistance to death induced by oxidative stress, indicating SET involvement through caspase-independent mechanism. The red fluorescence induced by siSET in HN13 cells in the acridine orange assay suggests SET-dependent prevention of AVOs acidification. NM23-H1 protein was restricted to the cytoplasm of siSET/siNC HN13 cells under oxidative stress, in association with decrease of cleaved SET levels. In the presence of oxidative stress, siNC HN13 cells showed lower GSH antioxidant defense (GSH/GSSG ratio) but higher expression of the antioxidant genes PRDX6, SOD2 and TXN compared to siSET HN13 cells. Still under oxidative stress, p-Akt levels were increased in siNC HN13 cells but not in siSET HN13, indicating its involvement in HN13 cell survival. Similar results for the main SET effects were observed in HN12 and CAL 27 cell lineages, except that HN13 cells were more resistant to death. Conclusion: SET is potential (i) marker for HNSCC associated with cancer cell resistance and (ii) new target in cancer therapy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Riboflavin secretion by Hyoscyamus albus hairy roots under Fe deficiency was examined to determine where riboflavin is produced and whether production occurs via an enhancement of riboflavin biosynthesis or a stimulation of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) hydrolysis. Confocal fluorescent microscopy showed that riboflavin was mainly localized in the epidermis and cortex of the root tip and, at the cellular level, in the apoplast. The expressions of three genes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of riboflavin (GTP cyclohydrolase II/3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase; 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase; riboflavin synthase) were compared between Fe-starved and Fe-replete roots over a time-course of 7 days, using RT-PCR. All three genes were found to be highly expressed over the period 1-7 days in the roots cultured under Fe deficiency. Since riboflavin secretion began to be detected only from 3 days, there was a lag phase observed between the increased transcript accumulations and riboflavin secretion. To determine whether FMN hydrolysis might contribute to the riboflavin secretion in Fe-deficient root cultures, FMN hydrolase activity was determined and was found to be substantially increased after 3 days, when riboflavin secretion became detectable. These results suggested that not only de nova riboflavin synthesis but also the hydrolysis of FMN contributes to riboflavin secretion under conditions of Fe deficiency. Respiration activity was assayed during the time-course, and was also found to be enhanced after 3 days under Fe deficiency, suggesting a possible link with riboflavin secretion. On the other hand, several respiratory inhibitors were found not to affect riboflavin synthase transcript accumulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the remarkable role of the microwave power density of argon plasma in the inactivation of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus and Bacillus pumilus spores deposited on polypropylene bio-indicator carriers. In particular, spore survival by argon plasma was determined as a function of the initial spore density of the bio-indicators. The microwave induced argon plasmas were generated at 1.47, 2.63 and 4.21 w/cm3 microwave power densities under a low gas pressure of 50 Pa at an ambient temperature of 15 $^\circ$C to reach low temperature distribution of 31, 35 and 43 $^\circ$C, respectively. Our results indicate that the different Bacillus spores showed distinct degrees of argon plasma sensitivity, and spore survival was significantly reduced when the microwave power density of the plasma treatments was increased. Among the three Bacillus strains, Bacillus subtilis was the most argon plasma resistant, whereas Bacillus stearothermophilus was the most sensitive. However, spore survival was not affected by the initial spore density of the bio-indicators. Only a certain degree of the spore inactivation log (No/N) from 1.67 to 1.95 was observed despite the 4-order differences in the initial spore density of the Bacillus pumilus bio-indicators.},

However, little is known about the pathogenicity of this specialized group of filamentous fungi, for which molecular research has been limited thus far. During experimental infection of guinea pigs by the human pathogenic dermatophyte Arthroderma benhamiae, we recently detected the activation of the fungal gene encoding malate synthase AcuE, a key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle. By the establishment of the first genetic system for A. benhamiae, specific Delta acuE mutants were constructed in a wild-type strain and, in addition, in a derivative in which we inactivated the nonhomologous end-joining pathway by deletion of the A. benhamiae KU70 gene. The absence of AbenKU70 resulted in an increased frequency of the targeted insertion of linear DNA by homologous recombination, without notably altering the monitored in vitro growth abilities of the fungus or its virulence in a guinea pig infection model. Phenotypic analyses of Delta acuE mutants and complemented strains depicted that malate synthase is required for the growth of A. benhamiae on lipids, major constituents of the skin. However, mutant analysis did not reveal a pathogenic role of the A. benhamiae enzyme in guinea pig dermatophytosis or during epidermal invasion of the fungus in an in vitro model of reconstituted human epidermis. The presented efficient system for targeted genetic manipulation in A. benhamiae, paired with the analyzed infection models, will advance the functional characterization of putative virulence determinants in medically important dermatophytes.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables researchers to directly probe endogenous molecules directly within the architecture of the biological matrix. Unfortunately, efficient access, management, and analysis of the data generated by MSI approaches remain major challenges to this rapidly developing field. Despite the availability of numerous dedicated file formats and software packages, it is a widely held viewpoint that the biggest challenge is simply opening, sharing, and analyzing a file without loss of information. Here we present OpenMSI, a software framework and platform that addresses these challenges via an advanced, high-performance, extensible file format and Web API for remote data access (http://openmsi.nersc.gov). The OpenMSI file format supports storage of raw MSI data, metadata, and derived analyses in a single, self-describing format based on HDF5 and is supported by a large range of analysis software (e.g., Matlab and R) and programming languages (e.g., C++, Fortran, and Python). Careful optimization of the storage layout of MSI data sets using chunking, compression, and data replication accelerates common, selective data access operations while minimizing data storage requirements and are critical enablers of rapid data I/O. The OpenMSI file format has shown to provide $>$2000-fold improvement for image access operations, enabling spectrum and image retrieval in less than 0.3 s across the Internet even for 50 GB MSI data sets. To make remote high-performance compute resources accessible for analysis and to facilitate data sharing and collaboration, we describe an easy-to-use yet powerful Web API, enabling fast and convenient access to MSI data, metadata, and derived analysis results stored remotely to facilitate high-performance data analysis and enable implementation of Web based data sharing, visualization, and analysis.},

Although the treatment temperature did not exceed 55$^\circ$C when exciting these plasmas, spore survival varied widely depending on the composition of the gas feed. Higher spore mortality was acquired by inert gases of low molecular weight except for helium. The highest spore mortality (4$\cdot$54log reduction) was obtained when air with a 0$\cdot$05 molar fraction of water vapour was used as the plasma carrier gas.Conclusions: Water molecules in the plasma carrier gas play a significant role in inactivation of B. pumilus spores.Significance and Impact of the Study: This strong inactivation may occur through hydroxyl free radicals generated from the moisturized air plasma.},

  abstract = {Background
Broad-based collaborations are becoming increasingly common among disease researchers. For example, the Global HIV Enterprise has united cross-disciplinary consortia to speed progress towards HIV vaccines through coordinated research across the boundaries of institutions, continents and specialties. New, end-to-end software tools for data and specimen management are necessary to achieve the ambitious goals of such alliances. These tools must enable researchers to organize and integrate heterogeneous data early in the discovery process, standardize processes, gain new insights into pooled data and collaborate securely.

Results
To meet these needs, we enhanced the LabKey Server platform, formerly known as CPAS. This freely available, open source software is maintained by professional engineers who use commercially proven practices for software development and maintenance. Recent enhancements support: (i) Submitting specimens requests across collaborating organizations (ii) Graphically defining new experimental data types, metadata and wizards for data collection (iii) Transitioning experimental results from a multiplicity of spreadsheets to custom tables in a shared database (iv) Securely organizing, integrating, analyzing, visualizing and sharing diverse data types, from clinical records to specimens to complex assays (v) Interacting dynamically with external data sources (vi) Tracking study participants and cohorts over time (vii) Developing custom interfaces using client libraries (viii) Authoring custom visualizations in a built-in R scripting environment., Diverse research organizations have adopted and adapted LabKey Server, including consortia within the Global HIV Enterprise. Atlas is an installation of LabKey Server that has been tailored to serve these consortia. It is in production use and demonstrates the core capabilities of LabKey Server. Atlas now has over 2,800 active user accounts originating from approximately 36 countries and 350 organizations. It tracks roughly 27,000 assay runs, 860,000 specimen vials and 1,300,000 vial transfers.

Conclusions
Sharing data, analysis tools and infrastructure can speed the efforts of large research consortia by enhancing efficiency and enabling new insights. The Atlas installation of LabKey Server demonstrates the utility of the LabKey platform for collaborative research. Stable, supported builds of LabKey Server are freely available for download at http://www.labkey.org. Documentation and source code are available under the Apache License 2.0.},

In the absence of substrate, this intermediate is unusually stable (t(1/2) = 7 min at 20 degrees C), allowing for its accumulation to almost stoichiometric amounts. Its decay is accelerated similar to 10(5)-fold by the substrate, pABA, implying that it is the complex that effects the two-electron oxidation of the amine to the hydroxylamine. The nearly quantitative conversion of pABA to pNBA by solutions containing an excess of the intermediate suggests that it may also be competent for the two subsequent two-electron oxidations leading to the product.},

Hence, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation were prevented. We further found that the anti-apoptotic effect depends on both host cell de novo protein synthesis and phagocytosis of conidia by macrophages. Moreover, sustained PI3K/Akt signalling in infected cells is an important determinant to resist apoptosis. We demonstrate that pigmentless pksP mutant conidia of A. fumigatus failed to trigger protection against apoptosis and provide evidence that the sustained survival of infected macrophages depends on the presence of the grey-green conidial pigment consisting of dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin. In conclusion, we revealed a novel potential function of melanin in the pathogenesis of A. fumigatus. For the first time, we show that melanin itself is a crucial component to inhibit macrophage apoptosis which may contribute to dissemination of the fungus within the host.},

  abstract = {Abstract
Coffee is the second most valuable commodity exported by developing countries. The Coffea genus comprises over 103 species but coffee production uses only two species throughout the tropics: Coffea canephora, which is self-sterile and diploid and better known as Robusta, and C. arabica, which is self-fertile and tetraploid. With the arrival of new analytical technologies and the start of genome sequencing projects, it was clearly time to review the state of the art of coffee genetics and genomics.

In the first part of this chapter, we present the main results concerning genetic diversity and phylogeny \textendash{} the most advanced fields \textendash{} based on large molecular marker sets, such as random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR), single sequence repeats (SSRs), or conserved orthologue set (COS), which are mainly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based. These markers also enable the construction of genetic maps and the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for both morphological and biochemical traits.

In the second part, after reviewing current knowledge on variation in coffee genome size and insights into cytogenetics, we focus on currently available genomic resources and web facilities. Large sets of expressed sequences tags (ESTs) and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries for both C. canephora and C. arabica have been obtained along with information on genes and specific metabolic pathways.

In the final section, we describe recently designed tools and their ultimate goal, which is to facilitate the sequencing, assembly and annotation of the first Coffea genome. We are at the gate of a new era of scientific approaches to coffee that should lead to a better understanding of phylogenetic relationships and genome evolution within the genus. Finally, taken together, this information should help develop improved varieties to meet the new challenges represented by ongoing radical changes in the environment.},

  abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is an important human fungal pathogen. The Aspergillus fumigatus genome contains 14 nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes, potentially responsible for generating metabolites that contribute to organismal virulence. Differential expression of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene, pes1, in four strains of Aspergillus fumigatus was observed. The pattern of pes1 expression differed from that of a putative siderophore synthetase gene, sidD, and so is unlikely to be involved in iron acquisition. The Pes1 protein (expected molecular mass 698 kDa) was partially purified and identified by immunoreactivity, peptide mass fingerprinting (36\% sequence coverage) and MALDI LIFT-TOF/TOF MS (four internal peptides sequenced). A pes1 disruption mutant (Delta pes1) of Aspergillus fumigatus strain 293.1 was generated and confirmed by Southern and western analysis, in addition to RT-PCR. The Delta pes1 mutant also showed significantly reduced virulence in the Galleria mellonella model system (P $<$ 0.001) and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (P = 0.002) in culture and during neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis. In addition, the mutant exhibited altered conidial surface morphology and hydrophilicity, compared to Aspergillus fumigatus 293.1. It is concluded that pes1 contributes to improved fungal tolerance against oxidative stress, mediated by the conidial phenotype, during the infection process.},

  abstract = {Soil represents a very heterogeneous environment for its microbiota. Among the soil inhabitants, bacteria and fungi are important organisms as they are involved in key biogeochemical cycling processes. A main energy source driving the system is formed by plants through the provision of plant-fixed (reduced) carbon to the soil, whereas soil nitrogen and phosphorus may move from the soil back to the plant. The carbonaceous compounds released form the key energy and nutrient sources for the soil microbiota. In the grossly carbon-limited soil, the emergence of plant roots and the formation of their associated mycorrhizae thus create nutritional hot spots for soil-dwelling bacteria. As there is natural (fitness) selection on bacteria in the soil, those bacteria that are best able to benefit from the hot spots have probably been selected. The purpose of this review is to examine the interactions of bacteria with soil fungi in these hot spots and to highlight the key mechanisms involved in the selection of fungal-responsive bacteria. Salient bacterial mechanisms that are involved in these interactions have emerged from this examination. Thus, the efficient acquisition for specific released nutrients, the presence of type-III secretion systems and the capacity of flagellar movement and to form a biofilm are pinpointed as key aspects of bacterial life in the mycosphere. The possible involvement of functions present on plasmid-borne genes is also interrogated.},

  abstract = {Mycotrophic species of Trichoderma are among the most common fungi isolated from free soil, dead wood and as parasites on sporocarps of other fungi (mycoparasites). In addition, they undergo various other biotrophic associations ranging from rhizosphere colonization and endophytism up to facultative pathogenesis on such animals as roundworms and humans. Together with occurrence on a variety of less common substrata (marine invertebrates, artificial materials, indoor habitats), these lifestyles illustrate a wealthy opportunistic potential of the fungus. One tropical species, Trichoderma reesei, has become a prominent producer of cellulases and hemicellulases, whereas several other species are applied in agriculture for the biological control of phytopathogenic fungi. The sequencing of the complete genomes of the three species (T. reesei, T. virens, and T. atroviride) has led to a deepened understanding of Trichoderma lifestyle and its molecular physiology. In this review, we present the in silico predicted secretome of Trichoderma, and in addition to the unique features of carbohydrate active enzymes demonstrate the importance of such protein families as proteases, oxidative enzymes, and small cysteine-rich proteins, all of that received little attention in Trichoderma genetics so far. We also discuss the link between Trichoderma secretome and biology of the fungus.},

  abstract = {When researchers build high-quality models of protein structure from sequence homology, it is today common to use several alternative target-template alignments. Several methods can, at least in theory, utilize information from multiple templates, and many examples of improved model quality have been reported. However, to our knowledge, thus far no study has shown that automatic inclusion of multiple alignments is guaranteed to improve models without artifacts. Here, we have carried out a systematic investigation of the potential of multiple templates to improving homology model quality. We have used test sets consisting of targets from both recent CASP experiments and a larger reference set. In addition to Modeller and Nest, a new method (Pfrag) for multiple template-based modeling is used, based on the segment-matching algorithm from Levitt's SegMod program. Our results show that all programs can produce multi-template models better than any of the single-template models, but a large part of the improvement is simply due to extension of the models. Most of the remaining improved cases were produced by Modeller. The most important factor is the existence of high-quality single-sequence input alignments. Because of the existence of models that are worse than any of the top single-template models, the average model quality does not improve significantly. However, by ranking models with a model quality assessment program such as ProQ, the average quality is improved by approximately 5\% in the CASP7 test set.},

This technique is now widely used for in situ imaging of endogenous or exogenous molecules such as proteins, lipids, drugs and their metabolites, and it is a potential tool for pathological analysis and the investigation of disease mechanisms. MSI is also thought to be a technique that could be used for biomarker discovery with spatial information. The application of MSI to the study of endogenous metabolites has received considerable attention because metabolites are the result of the interactions of a system's genome with its environment and a total set of these metabolites more closely represents the phenotype of an organism under a given set of conditions. Recent studies have suggested the importance of in situ metabolite imaging in biological discovery and biomedical applications, but several issues regarding the technical application limits of MSI still remained to be resolved. In this review, we describe the capabilities of the latest MSI techniques for the imaging of endogenous metabolites in biological samples, and also discuss the technical problems and new challenges that need to be addressed for effective and widespread application of MSI in both preclinical and clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Utilizing an ionized gas (plasma) to achieve sterilization is an alternative to conventional sterilization means as far as sterilization of heat-sensitive materials and innocuity of sterilizing agents are concerned. The literature on plasma sterilization is reviewed. A major issue of plasma sterilization is the respective roles of UV photons and reactive species such as atomic and radicals. Insight into this matter is obtained by analyzing the survival curves of microorganisms. In contrast to classical sterilization where such plots show a unique straight line, plasma sterilization yields survival diagrams with two or three different linear segments. Three basic mechanisms are involved in the plasma inactivation of microorganisms: (A) direct destruction by UV irradiation of the genetic material of microorganisms; (B) erosion of the microorganisms atom by atom, through intrinsic photodesorption by UV irradiation to form volatile compounds combining atoms intrinsic to the microorganisms; (C) erosion of the microorganisms, atom by atom, through etching to form volatile compounds as a result of slow combustion using oxygen atoms or radicals emanating from the plasma. In some cases, etching is further activated by UV photons, increasing the elimination rate of microorganisms. These mechanisms make plasma sterilization totally different from classical sterilization techniques and suggest its use to inactivate nonconventional infectious agents such as the abnormal prions.},

Using peptide assignments to spectra generated from a sample of 18 purified proteins, as well as complex H. influenzae and Halobacterium samples, the model is shown to produce probabilities that are accurate and have high power to discriminate correct from incorrect protein identifications. This method allows filtering of large-scale proteomics data sets with predictable sensitivity and false positive identification error rates. Fast, consistent, and transparent, it provides a standard for publishing large-scale protein identification data sets in the literature and for comparing the results obtained from different experiments.},

Secreted or intracellularly located NRP products include the toxic molecule gliotoxin and the iron-chelating siderophores triacetylfusarinine C and ferricrocin. No structural or immunologically relevant NRP products have been identified in the organism. We investigated the function of the largest gene in A. fumigatus, which encodes the NRP synthetase Pes3 (AFUA\_5G12730), by targeted gene deletion and extensive phenotypic analysis. It was observed that in contrast to other NRP synthetases, deletion of pes3 significantly increases the virulence of A. fumigatus, whereby the pes3 deletion strain (A. fumigatus Delta pes3) exhibited heightened virulence (increased killing) in invertebrate (P $<$ 0.001) and increased fungal burden (P = 0.008) in a corticosteroid model of murine pulmonary aspergillosis. Complementation restored the wild-type phenotype in the invertebrate model. Deletion of pes3 also resulted in increased susceptibility to the antifungal, voriconazole (P $<$ 0.01), shorter germlings, and significantly reduced surface beta-glucan (P = 0.0325). Extensive metabolite profiling revealed that Pes3 does not produce a secreted or intracellularly stored NRP in A. fumigatus. Macrophage infections and histological analysis of infected murine tissue indicate that Delta pes3 heightened virulence appears to be mediated by aberrant innate immune recognition of the fungus. Proteome alterations in A. fumigatus Delta pes3 strongly suggest impaired germination capacity. Uniquely, our data strongly indicate a structural role for the Pes3-encoded NRP, a finding that appears to be novel for an NRP synthetase.},

The arylamine N-oxygenase (AAO) from Streptomyces thioluteus (AurF) selectively oxidizes p-aminobenzoic acid to p-nitrobenzoic acid and has been the subject of investigation for its unique chemistry and substrate preferences. Little, however, is known about the biochemistry and substrate specificities of AurF homologues, which are often associated with non-ribosomal peptide synthetases or polyketide synthases and have substrate binding pockets with substantially different amino acid compositions based on sequence alignments. An AAO homolog from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola was expressed and purified to further explore the substrate specificity and biosynthetic utility of this enzyme class. PsAAO-was most active on substituted o-aminophenols at pH 9 in buffer solutions containing 40\% methanol. o-Aminophenols allow both the Pseudomonas and Streptomyces AAOs to act on para-substituted arylamines having methoxy, methyl, and nitro groups, which was previously unseen. A Hammett plot of k(cat,app) VS. sigma has a rho = 1.5, indicating substrate reactivity is dependent on the electron donating effects of substituents. The mechanistic data are consistent with an amine lone pair attacking an activated oxygen atom after formation of the hydroperoxy Fe(III/III) intermediate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

External digestion of protein substrates by secreted proteases is required for survival and growth of both saprophytic and pathogenic species. Extracellular serine, aspartic, and metalloproteases are considered virulence factors of many pathogenic species. New findings focus on novel membrane-associated proteases such as yapsins and ADAMs and their role in pathology. Proteases from fungi induce inflammatory responses by altering the permeability of epithelial barrier and by induction of proinflammatory cytokines through protease-activated receptors. Many fungal allergens possess proteolytic activity that appears to be essential in eliciting Th2 responses. Allergenic fungal proteases can act as adjuvants, potentiating responses to other allergens. Proteolytic enzymes from fungi contribute to inflammation through interactions with the kinin system as well as the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades. Their effect on the host protease-antiprotease balance results from activation of endogenous proteases and degradation of protease inhibitors. Recent studies of the role of fungi in human health point to the growing importance of proteases not only as pathogenic agents in fungal infections but also in asthma, allergy, and damp building related illnesses. Proteolytic enzymes from fungi are widely used in biotechnology, mainly in food, leather, and detergent industries, in ecological bioremediation processes and to produce therapeutic peptides. The involvement of fungal proteases in diverse pathological mechanisms makes them potential targets of therapeutic intervention and candidates for biomarkers of disease and exposure.},

To overcome this hurdle, some efforts have been made to establish plant cell cultures in vitro to use the system as a continuous source of plant enzymes. The focus of this review will be the production of plant peroxidases in vitro, including novel approaches such as the use of bioreactors and genetically transformed tissues to enhance the yield of desired enzymes.},

  abstract = {A nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which possesses an unusual structure incorporating three adenylation domains, six thiolation domains and six condensation domains, has been shown to produce the cyclohexopeptide siderophore ferrichrome. One of the adenylation domains is truncated and contains a distorted key motif. Substrate-binding specificities of the remaining two domains were assigned by molecular modelling to glycine and to N-acetyl-N-hydroxy-L-ornithine, Hexapeptide siderophore synthetase genes of Magnaporthe grisea and Fusarium graminearum were both identified and analyzed with respect to substrate-binding sites, and the predicted product ferricrocin was identified in each. A comparative analysis of these synthetase systems, including those of the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis, the homobosidiomycete Omphalotus olearius and the ascomycetes Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium graminearum, Cochliobolus heterostrophus, Neurospora crassa and Aureobasidium pullulans, revealed divergent domain compositions with respect to their number and positioning, although all produce similar products by iterative processes. A phylogenetic analysis of both NRPSs and associated L-N-5-ornithine monooxygenoses revealed that ferrichrome-type siderophore biosynthesis has coevolved in fungi with varying in trans interactions of NRPS domains.},

Accordingly, the enzymes involved in the synthesis of the U. maydis wall polysaccharides chitin and beta-1,6 glucans displayed some differential characteristics. The most salient difference in protein composition was the predicted absence of Pir proteins, an important class of proteins present in the Ascomycetes. Other classes of proteins that are covalently-linked to the wall in Ascomycetes, including those bound through disulfide linkages, joined by alkali-labile bonds, and GPI proteins, were predicted to be present in the U. maydis walls. The main characteristic of the exo-cellular, non-covalently-bound proteins was their relative low number, especially for hydrolytic enzymes.},

A survey was conducted of four tandem mass spectrometry peptide identification search algorithms, including Mascot, Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm, Sequest, and X! Tandem. The same input data, search parameters, and sequence library were used for the searches. Comparisons were based on commonly used scoring methodologies for each algorithm and on the results of a target-decoy approach to sequence library searching. The results indicated that there is little difference in the output of the algorithms so long as consistent scoring procedures are applied. The results showed that some commonly used scoring procedures may lead to excessive false discovery rates. Finally an alternative method for the determination of an optimal cutoff threshold is proposed.},

Sap9 and Sap10 are cell surface-associated proteases which function in C. albicans cell wall integrity and interaction with human epithelial cells and neutrophils. In this study, we have analyzed the enzymatic properties of Sap9 and Sap10 and investigated whether these proteases cleave proteins on the fungal cell surface. We show that Sap9 and Sap10, in contrast to other aspartic proteases, exhibit a near-neutral pH optimum of proteolytic activity and prefer the processing of peptides containing basic or dibasic residues. However, both proteases also cleaved at nonbasic sites, and not all tested peptides with dibasic residues were processed. By digesting isolated cell walls with Sap9 or Sap10, we identified the covalently linked cell wall proteins (CWPs) Cht2, Ywp1, Als2, Rhd3, Rbt5, Ecm33, and Pga4 as in vitro protease substrates. Proteolytic cleavage of the chitinase Cht2 and the glucan-cross-linking protein Pir1 by Sap9 was verified using hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged versions of both proteins. Deletion of the SAP9 and SAP10 genes resulted in a reduction of cell-associated chitinase activity similar to that upon deletion of CHT2, suggesting a direct influence of Sap9 and Sap10 on Cht2 function. In contrast, cell surface changes elicited by SAP9 and SAP10 deletion had no major impact on the phagocytosis and killing of C. albicans by human macrophages. We propose that Sap9 and Sap10 influence distinct cell wall functions by proteolytic cleavage of covalently linked cell wall proteins.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary theory is firmly grounded on the existence of trade-offs between life-history traits, and recent interest has centred on the physiological mechanisms underlying such trade-offs. Several branches of evolutionary biology, particularly those focusing on ageing, immunological and sexual selection theory, have implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) as profound evolutionary players. ROS are a highly reactive group of oxygen-containing molecules, generated as common by-products of vital oxidative enzyme complexes. Both animals and plants appear to intentionally harness ROS for use as molecular messengers to fulfil a wide range of essential biological processes. However, at high levels, ROS are known to exert very damaging effects through oxidative stress. For these reasons, ROS have been suggested to be important mediators of the cost of reproduction, and of trade-offs between metabolic rate and lifespan, and between immunity, sexual ornamentation and sperm quality. In this review, we integrate the above suggestions into one life-history framework, and review the evidence in support of the contention that ROS production will constitute a primary and universal constraint in life-history evolution.},

Melanin is an important virulence factor of S. schenckii, which produces dihydroxynaphthalene melanin (DHN-melanin) in conidia and yeast cells. Additionally, L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) can be used to enhance melanin production on these structures as well as on hyphae. Some fungi are able to synthesize another type of melanoid pigment, called pyomelanin, as a result of tyrosine catabolism. Since there is no information about tyrosine catabolism in Sporothrix spp., we cultured 73 strains, including representatives of newly described Sporothrix species of medical interest, such as S. brasiliensis, S. schenckii, and S. globosa, in minimal medium with tyrosine. All strains but one were able to produce a melanoid pigment with a negative charge in this culture medium after 9 days of incubation. An S. schenckii DHN-melanin mutant strain also produced pigment in the presence of tyrosine. Further analysis showed that pigment production occurs in both the filamentous and yeast phases, and pigment accumulates in supernatants during stationary-phase growth. Notably, sulcotrione inhibits pigment production. Melanin ghosts of wild-type and DHN mutant strains obtained when the fungus was cultured with tyrosine were similar to melanin ghosts yielded in the absence of the precursor, indicating that this melanin does not polymerize on the fungal cell wall. However, pyomelanin-producing fungal cells were more resistant to nitrogen-derived oxidants and to UV light. In conclusion, at least three species of the Sporothrix complex are able to produce pyomelanin in the presence of tyrosine, and this pigment might be involved in virulence.},

Using 1-D gel electrophoresis coupled with ESI-MS/MS, we indentified 638 unique proteins. Most of these proteins were related to the metabolic and cellular processes, and the transport machinery of cells. In a second step, we examined the influence of water deprivation on the proteome of C. geophilum pure cultures at three time points of gradually imposed drought. The results indicated that 12 proteins were differentially abundant in mycelia subjected to drought compared to controls. The induced responses in C. geophilum point towards regulation of osmotic stress, maintainance of cell integrity, and counteracting increased levels of reactive oxygen species formed during water deprivation.

  abstract = {Fungi have the potential to produce a wide range of secondary metabolites including polyketides and small peptides produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NPS). Fusarium graminearum is a mycotoxin producing pathogen of cereals and knowledge of the infection process is essential for the development of disease control. Bioinformatics provide a means to identify genes encoding NPSs, the products of which may act as fungal virulence factors. The F. graminearum genome sequence was analysed and similarity searches and application of prediction server service identified 15 putative NPS genes. NPS1 and NPS2, were found to be related to genes involved in NPS hydroxamate siderophore biosynthesis and chemical analysis of a F. graminearum NPS2 deletion mutant showed that this gene encodes the NPS responsible for the biosynthesis of ferricrocin. The expression of the NPS genes was analysed in Fusarium culmorum. NPS1 and NPS19 differed from the remainder of the genes, as they were only expressed during infection of barley roots and not under the different culture conditions tested. Strains of F. graminearum, F. culmorum and Fusarium pseudograminearum were examined for the presence and expression of the 15 identified NPS genes. With the exception of NPS18, that is absent in F. pseudograminearum, all the NPS genes are represented in the diffferent species. Lack of transcripts from some genes and the presence of frameshift and stop codons in four of the NPS genes in the sequenced F. graminearum strain suggest that some are pseudogenes.},

There is an intrinsic potential to be able to identify the biomarkers in the same experiment, or by relatively simple extension of the technique. Unlike many other imaging techniques, no a priori knowledge of the markers being sought is necessary. This review concentrates on the use of MALDI-MS for MS imaging (MSI) of proteins and peptides, with an emphasis on mammalian tissue. We discuss the methodologies used, their potential limitations, overall experimental considerations and progress that has been made towards establishing MALDI-MSI as a routine technique for the spatially resolved measurement of peptides and proteins. As well as determining the local abundance of individual molecular ions, there is the potential to determine their identity within the same experiment using relatively simple extensions of the basic techniques. In this way MSI offers an important opportunity for biomarker discovery and identification.},

  abstract = {Over 100 mutations in Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) result in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Dimer dissociation is the first step in SOD1 aggregation, and studies suggest nearly every amino acid residue in SOD1 is dynamically connected to the dimer interface. Post-translational modifications of SOD1 residues might be expected to have similar effects to mutations, but few modifications have been identified. Here we show, using SOD1 isolated from human erythrocytes, that human SOD1 is phosphorylated at threonine 2 and glutathionylated at cysteine 111. A second SOD1 phosphorylation was observed and mapped to either Thr-58 or Ser-59. Cysteine 111 glutathionylation promotes SOD1 monomer formation, a necessary initiating step in SOD1 aggregation, by causing a 2-fold increase in the K(d). This change in the dimer stability is expected to result in a 67\% increase in monomer concentration, 315 nm rather than 212 nm at physiological SOD1 concentrations. Because protein glutathionylation is associated with redox regulation, our finding that glutathionylation promotes SOD1 monomer formation supports a model in which increased oxidative stress promotes SOD1 aggregation.},

Accessions represented C. annuum, C. chinense, C. frutescens and C. baccatum species, which were selected based on variation in morphological characters, pungency and geographic origin. Genotypic analysis using AFLP markers confirmed the phylogenetic clustering of accessions according to Capsicum species and separated C. baccatum from the C. annuum\textendash{}C. chinense\textendash{}C. frutescens complex. Species-specific clustering was also observed when accessions were grouped based on their semi-polar metabolite profiles. In total 88 semi-polar metabolites could be putatively identified. A large proportion of these metabolites represented conjugates of the main pepper flavonoids (quercetin, apigenin and luteolin) decorated with different sugar groups at different positions along the aglycone. In addition, a large group of acyclic diterpenoid glycosides, called capsianosides, was found to be highly abundant in all C. annuum genotypes. In contrast to the variation in semi-polar metabolites, the variation in volatiles corresponded well to the differences in pungency between the accessions. This was particularly true for branched fatty acid esters present in pungent accessions, which may reflect the activity through the acyl branch of the metabolic pathway leading to capsaicinoids. In addition, large genetic variation was observed for many well-established pepper aroma compounds. These profiling data can be used in breeding programs aimed at improving metabolite-based quality traits such as flavour and health-related metabolites in pepper fruits.},

Brews extracted from medium roasted coffee showed a higher RSA than those from green coffee due to an increase of the RSA of the NPF upon roasting. The RSA of the NPF increased with increasing roasting degree together with the accumulation of brown coloured Maillard reaction products (MRPs). Brews from dark coffee showed lower RSA than those from medium roasted coffee due to polyphenols degradation which, in turn, caused an RSA depletion not counterbalanced by an increase of the RSA of NPF. The relative contribution of NPF to the overall RSA of the brew is in fact much lower than that of the PF. Roasting processes with similar C T ref z values resulted in the same RSA independent of an average temperature variation from 170 to 190 $^\circ$C and coffee type.

The AOA changes in brews from commercial coffee samples (medium and dark roasted) were more dependent on roasting severity than on the type of coffee.},

  abstract = {Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) is currently recognised as a major risk factor for the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). HPV is mostly detected in tumours arising from the oropharynx and more specifically from the tonsil. HPV-related tumours display clinical and molecular characteristics that are distinct from HPV-unrelated tumours, which are generally induced by alcohol and tobacco abuse. Detection of biologically active HPV in HNSCC has prognostic relevance, which warrants the separate classification of HPV-induced tumours and is a prerequisite for further optimisation of treatment protocols for this distinct group. Current guidelines for the treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) have not incorporated specific treatment modalities for HPV-related tumours. The development of such treatment options is still in a preclinical phase or in early clinical trials. Recent data on treatment response of OPSCC have been obtained by retrospectively analysing HPV-status and indicate that patients with HPV-related tumours show a favourable prognosis, independent of the type of treatment. These patients may benefit from de-intensified treatment, which should be assessed in prospective clinical trials. The development and future use of new antiviral and immunomodulatory therapeutics may be instrumental in this approach to improve survival rates and decrease disease-and-treatment-related morbidity. In this review we will focus on present therapeutic HPV-targeting strategies and discuss future directions for de-intensified treatment of HPV-positive HNSCC.

To test whether this prediction is also applicable to associations of bacteria with fungi, we explored patterns of molecular evolution in two lineages of mutualistic endosymbionts of fungi: the Burkholderia endosymbionts of Rhizopus microsporus (Mucormycotina) and Candidatus Glomeribacter gigasporarum endosymbionts of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota). We compared these two lineages with the closely related Candidatus Tremblaya princeps endosymbionts of mealybugs (Hemiptera, Coccoidea, Pseudococcidae) and to free-living Burkholderia species. To make inferences about the life histories of the endosymbionts, we relied on the empirically validated predictions of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution that a reduction of the effective population size increases the rate of fixation of slightly deleterious mutations. Our analyses showed that the slightly deleterious mutation accumulation patterns in the Burkholderia endosymbionts of Rhizopus were nearly indistinguishable from those in their free-living relatives. In contrast, Ca. Glomeribacter showed unique patterns of molecular evolution that differentiated them from both the Burkholderia endosymbionts of Rhizopus and from the Ca. Tremblaya endosymbionts of insects. These findings imply that reduced mixing of symbiont lineages is not a universal feature of symbioses between fungi and endocellular bacteria.},

  abstract = {Thaxtomin phytotoxins, first reported in 1989, are cyclic dipeptides (2,5-diketopiperazines) formed from the condensation of 4-nitrotrytophan and phenylalanine groups. Inclusion of a 4-nitroindole moiety that is an essential requirement for their phytotoxicity makes them unique amongst microbial generated metabolites. Individual thaxtomins differ only in the presence or absence of N-methyl and hydroxyl groups and their respective substitution sites. The name ``thaxtomin'' was assigned to these compounds in honor of the eminent American phytopathologist Roland Thaxter who first described the nature of the microorganisms responsible for their production. The great interest in the thaxtomins derives mainly from their established roles as virulence factors in the common scab of potato disease and their apparent ability to inhibit cellulose synthesis in developing plant cells. Surveys of comparable scab-inducing organisms from potato producing regions throughout the world have confirmed the generality of the phytotoxin associated process. Descriptions of the isolation, chemical structure determination, total synthesis, biosynthesis, transformation by microorganisms and biological activity of the thaxtomins are comprehensively reviewed.

  abstract = {Accurate modeling of peptide fragmentation is necessary for the development of robust scoring functions for peptide-spectrum matches, which are the cornerstone of MS/MS-based identification algorithms. Unfortunately, peptide fragmentation is a complex process that can involve several competing chemical pathways, which makes it difficult to develop generative probabilistic models that describe it accurately. However, the vast amounts of MS/MS data being generated now make it possible to use data-driven machine learning methods to develop discriminative ranking-based models that predict the intensity ranks of a peptide's fragment ions. We use simple sequence-based features that get combined by a boosting algorithm into models that make peak rank predictions with high accuracy. In an accompanying manuscript, we demonstrate how these prediction models are used to significantly improve the performance of peptide identification algorithms. The models can also be useful in the design of optimal multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions, in cases where there is insufficient experimental data to guide the peak selection process. The prediction algorithm can also be run independently through PepNovo+, which is available for download from http://bix.ucsd.edu/Software/PepNovo.html.},

We describe an unrestrictive PTM search algorithm, MS-Alignment, that searches for all types of PTMs at once in a blind mode, that is, without knowing which PTMs exist in nature. Blind PTM identification makes it possible to study the extent and frequency of different types of PTMs, still an open problem in proteomics. Application of this approach to lens proteins resulted in the largest set of PTMs reported in human crystallins so far. Our analysis of various MS/MS data sets implies that the biological phenomenon of modification is much more widespread than previously thought. We also argue that MS-Alignment reveals some uncharacterized modifications that warrant further experimental validation.},

This device is made of a millimeter-sized ceramic cavity with two platinum electrodes positioned face-to-face. He or Ar plasma can be generated by a direct current voltage of several hundreds of volts requiring a total power below 4 W. The thermal plume temperature of the He plasma was measured and found to be between 25 and 80 $^\circ$C at a normal discharge current. Gaseous, liquid, creamy, and solid samples with molecular weights up to 1.5 kDa could be examined in both positive and negative mode, giving limits of detection (LOD) at or below the fg/mm2 level. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of manual sampling ranged from 10\% to ?20\%, while correlation coefficients of the working curve (R2) are all above 0.98 with the addition of internal standards. The ionization mechanisms are examed via both optical and mass spectrometry. Due to the low temperature characteristics of the microplasma, nonthermal momentum desorption is considered to dominate the desorption process.},

Among the tools used for metabolomic research, mass spectrometry is one of the most powerful tools. However, metabolomics by mass spectrometry always reveals a high number of unknown compounds which complicate in depth mechanistic or biochemical understanding. In principle, mass spectrometry can be utilized within strategies of de novo structure elucidation of small molecules, starting with the computation of the elemental composition of an unknown metabolite using accurate masses with errors $<$5 ppm (parts per million). However even with very high mass accuracy ($<$1 ppm) many chemically possible formulae are obtained in higher mass regions. In automatic routines an additional orthogonal filter therefore needs to be applied in order to reduce the number of potential elemental compositions. This report demonstrates the necessity of isotope abundance information by mathematical confirmation of the concept.},

Portable hermetic storage bag, SuperGrainbags\texttrademark{} (SGBs) was tested against insect penetration Prostephanus truncatus, Rhyzopertha dominica, and Callosobruchus maculatus. Measurements of oxygen level, insect mortality, and insect damage were determined during six weeks. A new type of multi-layer SGB-IV-R co-extruded, with its ultra-low oxygen permeability of less than 4~cc/m2/day filled with grains of maize, wheat, and cowpea allows a significant decrease in the oxygen level after two weeks of storage. By week 4, 100\% mortality of insects is located inside the bag ($\leq$5 insect/kg) was observed. However, the trapped insects placed between the SGB-IV-R and outer mesh cage with no deprivation of oxygen ultimately penetrated from the outside. Under artificial insect density at 10 insect/kg, the SGB-IV-R was punctured after 3 and 6 weeks by the P.~truncatus and R.~dominica, respectively but no for C.~maculatus. In summary, when insect infestation is coming from grain harvest, successful control of all insects was achieved by SGB-IV-R, but effects of infestation from outside under natural (untrapped) field conditions needs to be validated.},

  doi = {10.1186/1471-2180-12-10},
  abstract = {Background: Mangotoxin is an antimetabolite toxin that is produced by strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae; mangotoxin-producing strains are primarily isolated from mango tissues with symptoms of bacterial apical necrosis. The toxin is an oligopeptide that inhibits ornithine N-acetyl transferase (OAT), a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the essential amino acids ornithine and arginine. The involvement of a putative nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene (mgoA) in mangotoxin production and virulence has been reported. Results: In the present study, we performed a RT-PCR analysis, insertional inactivation mutagenesis, a promoter expression analysis and terminator localisation to study the gene cluster containing the mgoA gene. Additionally, we evaluated the importance of mgoC, mgoA and mgoD in mangotoxin production. A sequence analysis revealed an operon-like organisation. A promoter sequence was located upstream of the mgoB gene and was found to drive lacZ transcription. Two terminators were located downstream of the mgoD gene. RT-PCR experiments indicated that the four genes (mgoBCAD) constitute a transcriptional unit. This operon is similar in genetic organisation to those in the three other P. syringae pathovars for which complete genomes are available (P. syringae pv. syringae B728a, P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A). Interestingly, none of these three reference strains is capable of producing mangotoxin. Additionally, extract complementation resulted in a recovery of mangotoxin production when the defective mutant was complemented with wild-type extracts. Conclusions: The results of this study confirm that mgoB, mgoC, mgoA and mgoD function as a transcriptional unit and operon. While this operon is composed of four genes, only the last three are directly involved in mangotoxin production.},

This fungal pathogen produces a set of aspartic proteases that directly contributes to virulence properties such as adhesion, tissue invasion, and immune evasion. We show here that, in contrast to other secreted proteases, the cell surface-associated isoform Sap9 has a major impact on the recognition of C. albicans by PMNs. SAP9 is required for the induction of PMN chemotaxis toward C. albicans filaments, an essential prerequisite of effective PMN activation. Furthermore, deletion of SAP9 leads to a mitigated release of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) in human PMNs and decreases C. albicans-induced apoptosis triggered by ROI formation. In confrontation assays, killing of a SAP9 deletion mutant is reduced in comparison to wild-type C. albicans. These data clearly implicate Sap9 protease activity in the initiation of protective innate immunity and suggest novel molecular mechanisms in C. albicans-host interaction leading to neutrophil activation.},

  abstract = {The identification and study of marine microorganisms with unique physiological traits can be a very powerful tool discovering novel enzymes of possible biotechnological interest. This approach can complement the enormous amount of data concerning gene diversity in marine environments offered by metagenomic analysis, and can help to place the activities associated with those sequences in the context of microbial cellular metabolism and physiology. Accordingly, the detection and isolation of microorganisms that may be a good source of enzymes is of great importance. Marinomonas mediterranea, for example, has proven to be one such useful microorganism. This Gram-negative marine bacterium was first selected because of the unusually high amounts of melanins synthesized in media containing the amino acid L-tyrosine. The study of its molecular biology has allowed the cloning of several genes encoding oxidases of biotechnological interest, particularly in white and red biotechnology. Characterization of the operon encoding the tyrosinase responsible for melanin synthesis revealed that a second gene in that operon encodes a protein, PpoB2, which is involved in copper transfer to tyrosinase. This finding made PpoB2 the first protein in the COG5486 group to which a physiological role has been assigned. Another enzyme of interest described in M. mediterranea is a multicopper oxidase encoding a membrane-associated enzyme that shows oxidative activity on a wide range of substrates typical of both laccases and tyrosinases. Finally, an enzyme very specific for L-lysine, which oxidises this amino acid in epsilon position and that has received a new EC number (1.4.3.20), has also been described for M. mediterranea. Overall, the studies carried out on this bacterium illustrate the power of exploring the physiology of selected microorganisms to discover novel enzymes of biotechnological relevance.},

  abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common opportunistic mold pathogen of humans, infecting immunocompromised patients. The fungus invades the lungs and other organs, causing severe damage. Penetration of the pulmonary epithelium is a key step in the infectious process. A. fumigatus produces extracellular proteases to degrade the host structural barriers. The A. fumigatus transcription factor PrtT controls the expression of multiple secreted proteases. PrtT shows similarity to the fungal Gal4-type Zn(2)-Cys(6) DNA-binding domain of several transcription factors. In this work, we further investigate the function of this transcription factor by performing a transcriptional and a proteomic analysis of the Delta prtT mutant. Unexpectedly, microarray analysis revealed that in addition to the expected decrease in protease expression, expression of genes involved in iron uptake and ergosterol synthesis was dramatically decreased in the Delta prtT mutant. A second finding of interest is that deletion of prtT resulted in the upregulation of four secondary metabolite clusters, including genes for the biosynthesis of toxic pseurotin A. Proteomic analysis identified reduced levels of three secreted proteases (ALP1 protease, TppA, AFUA\_2G01250) and increased levels of three secreted polysaccharide-degrading enzymes in the Delta prtT mutant possibly in response to its inability to derive sufficient nourishment from protein breakdown. This report highlights the complexity of gene regulation by PrtT, and suggests a potential novel link between the regulation of protease secretion and the control of iron uptake, ergosterol biosynthesis and secondary metabolite production in A. fumigatus.},

We now report the total synthesis of a B series analogue, arylomycin B-C-16, and its aromatic amine derivative.

  abstract = {The effects of a number of experimental parameters on the efficiency of ion transport by viscous gas flow through narrow capillaries have been studied. Both electrospray and corona ion sources were used. The experimental data are consistent with ions loss to the walls of the capillary, which initially is caused mainly by space-charge expansion, but later is caused by diffusion. These processes can result in severe discrimination against low mass ions. The extent of ion loss may be calculated by using a simple model for radial diffusional loss in long cylinders, with an exponential decay of the ion density along the transport capillary. However, such a simple model underestimates ion loss by ignoring the effects of space-charge, turbulent flow, and rapid decay of higher radial diffusion modes (enhanced loss of ions that enter the capillary close to the wall). In contrast, Monte Carlo simulations showed that the effect of the parabolic velocity profile, under laminar flow conditions, is to increase the transmitted ion current, sometimes by several orders of magnitude, relative to the predictions of the simple diffusion model. After considering all these factors, the transmitted current from a corona was well reproduced by using mobility values for ions formed in such discharges. However, the measured transmitted current from an electrospray source was much too high. To explain this, it was necessary to assume that about 2\% of the electrospray current is carried by aerosol particles with radii in the 10\textendash{}25-\AA{} range. Finally, it is argued that in glass capillaries wall charging may explain why the transmitted ion current is observed to be very similar to that in metal capillaries.},

Robusta (Robusta) by high performance anion exchange chromatography coupled to pulsed electrochemical detection (HPAE-PED). The majority of the components analysed either decreased in concentration during the first half of the development period or accumulated steadily during the latter half of the period. The profiles are taken to indicate relationships between the perisperm, the principal tissue in the young grain and the endosperm during maturation. While most of the free sugar in the mature grain is accounted for by sucrose, fructose and glucose are both at higher concentrations in the perisperm. Considerable amounts of myo-inositol (3\textendash{}4\% dry weight (DW)) are found in young grains, while only the phosphorylated form phytic acid occurs in mature grains (0.3\textendash{}0.6\% DW). Quinic acid, which is present in very low amounts in mature endosperm, represents between 6 and 16\% DW in young grains, this possibly being the major precursor pool for the high amounts of chlorogenic acids (5\textendash{}10\% DW) which are a characteristic of mature coffee grains. Of the other organic acids analysed, citric and malic acids are dominant in the mature grain, with higher concentrations in Arabica than Robusta. The results are discussed with respect to the potential implications for transport mechanisms in developing coffee grains and also the importance of the compounds analysed for industrial quality and flavour.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have revealed an important and intriguing role for human papillomavirus (HPV) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). There are indications that the prevalence of HPV-positive HNSCC has recently increased, and genetic analyses point to a completely distinct class of HNSCCs. Most studies suggest that patients with this type of tumour have a better prognosis and some argue that an adjusted therapeutic approach is needed. One crucial point in the research of HNSCC-HPV involvement has often been neglected, which is the lack of a standardised assay to detect HPV. This has resulted in a considerable variation in the frequency of HPV-positive tumours between studies reported thus far. Especially for PCR-based tests, the risk exists that the assay is too sensitive and detects virus without implying a causal involvement in HNSCC. A reliable algorithm to detect a clinically relevant HPV infection in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue has recently become available. Here, we address important biological and analytical aspects of HPV involved in the development of HNSCC and it is emphasised that a standardised HPV assay is a prerequisite for assessing the clinical importance of a HPV infection in HNSCC.

  abstract = {The analysis of the large volume of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) proteomics data that is generated these days relies on automated algorithms that identify peptides from their mass spectra. An essential component of these algorithms is the scoring function used to evaluate the quality of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). In this paper, we present new approach to scoring of PSMs. We argue that since this problem is at its core a ranking task (especially in the case of de novo sequencing), it can be solved effectively using machine learning ranking algorithms. We developed a new discriminative boosting-based approach to scoring. Our scoring models draw upon a large set of diverse feature functions that measure different qualities of PSMs. Our method improves the performance of our de novo sequencing algorithm beyond the current state-of-the-art, and also greatly enhances the performance of database search programs. Furthermore, by increasing the efficiency of tag filtration and improving the sensitivity of PSM scoring, we make it practical to perform large-scale MS/MS analysis, such as proteogenomic search of a six-frame translation of the human genome (in which we achieve a reduction of the running time by a factor of 15 and a 60\% increase in the number of identified peptides, compared to the InsPecT database search tool). Our scoring function is incorporated into PepNovo+ which is available for download or can be run online at http://bix.ucsd.edu.},

  abstract = {Background: Polyketides are natural products with a wide range of biological functions and pharmaceutical applications. Discovery and utilization of polyketides can be facilitated by understanding the evolutionary processes that gave rise to the biosynthetic machinery and the natural product potential of extant organisms. Gene duplication and subfunctionalization, as well as horizontal gene transfer are proposed mechanisms in the evolution of biosynthetic gene clusters. To explain the amount of homology in some polyketide synthases in unrelated organisms such as bacteria and fungi, interkingdom horizontal gene transfer has been evoked as the most likely evolutionary scenario. However, the origin of the genes and the direction of the transfer remained elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used comparative phylogenetics to infer the ancestor of a group of polyketide synthase genes involved in antibiotic and mycotoxin production. We aligned keto synthase domain sequences of all available fungal 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA)-type PKSs and their closest bacterial relatives. To assess the role of symbiotic fungi in the evolution of this gene we generated 24 6-MSA synthase sequence tags from lichen-forming fungi. Our results support an ancient horizontal gene transfer event from an actinobacterial source into ascomycete fungi, followed by gene duplication. Conclusions/Significance: Given that actinobacteria are unrivaled producers of biologically active compounds, such as antibiotics, it appears particularly promising to study biosynthetic genes of actinobacterial origin in fungi. The large number of 6-MSA-type PKS sequences found in lichen-forming fungi leads us hypothesize that the evolution of typical lichen compounds, such as orsellinic acid derivatives, was facilitated by the gain of this bacterial polyketide synthase.},

Addition of ammonium hydrogen carbonate to mobile phase achieved a simple and reliable HPLC/ESI-MS analysis of mono-, di-, and triphosphate compounds (six nucleotides) without peak tailing due to the interaction between stainless steel surfaces and phosphate groups. Moreover, ammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer, a volatile buffer with good buffering capacity at neutral pH, does not compromise the stability of silica-based HPLC columns, decreases in sensitivity, ion source pollution, clogging of the ESI interface, and/or ion suppression in HPLC/ESI-MS.

Using potentiometry, UV-visible titrations and circular dichroism, we determined stability constants for Ni(II) complexes of Hst-5 and two truncated analogs, 5Hst-5 (DSHAK) and 10Hst-5 (DSHAKRHHGY). The conditional binding constant at pH 7.4 for Hst-5 was 10(7.5 +/- 0.2), compared to the corresponding value for albumin, 10(6.8 +/- 0.3) (M. Sokolowska, A. Krezel, M. Dyba, Z. Szewczuk, W. Bal, Eur. J. Biochem. 269 (2002) 1323-1331). These values indicate that Hst-5 binds Ni (II) five times stronger than HSA. The simulated competition for Ni(II) between Hst-5 and albumin shows that significant amounts of Ni(II) ions may be carried by Hst-5 in vivo. Therefore, Hst-5 and other histatins should be considered as factors in nickel allergy and other forms of nickel toxicity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A low-temperature plasma (LTP) probe has been developed for ambient desorption ionization. An ac electric field is used to induce a dielectric barrier discharge through use of a specially designed electrode configuration. The low-temperature plasma is extracted from the probe where it interacts directly with the sample being analyzed, desorbing and ionizing surface molecules in the ambient environment. This allows experiments to be performed without damage to the sample or underlying substrate and, in the case of biological analysis on skin surfaces, without electrical shock or perceptible heating. Positive or negative ions are produced from a wide range of chemical compounds in the pure stateand as mixtures in the gaseous, solution, or condensed phases, using He, Ar, N2, or ambient air as the discharge gas. Limited fragmentation occurs, although it is greater in the cases of the molecular than the atomic discharge gases. The effectiveness of the LTP probe has been demonstrated by recording characteristic mass spectra and tandem mass spectra of samples containing hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) from poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) surfaces where limits of detection are as low as 5 pg. Other performance characteristics, when using a commercial ion trap mass spectrometer, include 3-4 orders of magnitude linear dynamic range in favorable cases. Demonstration applications include direct analysis of cocaine from human skin, determination of active ingredients directly in drug tablets, and analysis of toxic and therapeutic compounds in complex biological samples. Ionization of chemicals directly from bulk aqueous solution has been demonstrated, where limits of detection are as low as 1 ppb. Large surface area sampling and control of fragmentation by a simple adjustment of the electrode configuration during operation are other demonstrated characteristics of the method.},

In addition to filtering, InsPecT also uses novel algorithms for scoring and validating in the presence of modifications, without explicit enumeration of all variants. InsPecT identifies modified peptides with better or equivalent accuracy than other database search tools while being 2 orders of magnitude faster than SEQUEST, and substantially faster than X!TANDEM on complex mixtures.

  abstract = {Cultivation, processing, and consumption of coffee are dynamic processes that connect coffee farmers and agro-ecosystems with coffee drinkers spanning the globe. As a cash crop, coffee cultivation gained popularity in the Old and then the New world, and flourished under colonial regimes of the nineteenth and twentieth century. Coffee production patterns and management styles have changed $\-$drastically in the past two centuries and continue to shift, with the greatest recent expansions in East Asia. Traditionally, coffee is cultivated under a canopy of shade trees, a practice that ensures the longevity of the farm, supports biodiversity, and provides communities with a broad array of ecosystem services. However, many modern management schemes abandon shade practices. On the other hand, specialty coffee markets, like certified organic, certified shade (Bird Friendly), Fair Trade, and other certified coffees have gained recent popularity, though they still represent a small fraction of the global coffee economy. The global coffee economy is comprised of a wide array of coffee value chains that connect farmers with consumers, and thus impact farmer livelihoods at multiple spatial scales. Key players in the coffee value chain include local cooperatives, national government agencies, and global certification agencies. Similarly, ecosystem services provided by shade coffee occur at local, regional, and global scales, including pollination, erosion-control, and carbon sequestration, respectively. While the ecological and socio-economic costs and benefits associated with shade coffee are clear, this review reveals that there are many challenges to bridging sustainable coffee management with livelihood security. Furthermore, in this review we identify existing gaps in the literature and a number of promising research directions concerning the ecological and socio-economic impacts of coffee production.},

A comparison of these genes with the hypoxically regulated genes of Aspergillus nidulans based on their predicted amino acid sequences classified them as bi-directional best hit (BBH), one-way best hit (extra homolog, EH), and no-hit (non-syntenic genes, NSG) genes. Clustering analysis of the BBH genes indicated that A. oryzae and A. nidulans down-regulated global translation and transcription under hypoxic conditions, respectively. Under hypoxic conditions, both fungi up-regulated genes for alcohol fermentation and the gamma-aminobutyrate shunt of the tricarboxylate cycle, whereas A. oryzae up-regulated the glyoxylate pathway, indicating that both fungi eliminate NADH accumulation under hypoxic conditions. The A. oryzae NS genes included specific genes for secondary and nitric oxide metabolism under hypoxic conditions. This comparative transcriptomic analysis discovered common and strain-specific responses to hypoxia in hypoxic Aspergillus species.},

  volume = {9},
  issn = {1139-6709},
  abstract = {The ability of fungi to survive in many environments is linked to their capacity to acquire essential nutrients. Iron is generally complexed and available in very limited amounts. Like bacteria, fungi have evolved highly specific systems for iron acquisition. Production and uptake of iron-chelating siderophores has been shown to be important for certain human bacterial pathogens, as well as in fungal pathogens such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Fusarium graminearum. This system also enables the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus to infect and subsequently colonize the human lung. In this study, advantage was taken of genome sequence data available for both Aspergillus nidulans and A.fumigatus either to partially clone or to design PCR primers for 10 genes putatively involved in siderophore biosynthesis or uptake in A. fumigatus. The expression of these genes was then monitored by semi-quantitative and quantitative real-time PCR over a range of iron concentrations. As expected, the putative biosynthetic genes sidA, sidC and sidD were all strongly up-regulated under iron starvation conditions, although the variable degree of induction indicates complex regulation by a number of transcriptional factors, including the GATA family protein SreA. In contrast, the gene sidE shows no iron-regulation, suggesting that SidE may not be involved in siderophore biosynthesis. The characterisation of the expression patterns of this subset of genes in the iron regulon facilitates further studies into the importance of iron acquisition for pathogenesis of A. fumigatus.},

Some of the most carcinogen compounds transported by PM2.5 are nitro-compounds. In this study, a strengthened in vitro bioassay - able to predict the mutagenic/carcinogenic activity of the environmental mixtures - was conducted on PM2.5 organic extracts to define the nitro-compounds burden. PM2.5 air pollution was daily monitored, during 2006, in three cities located in the Northern part of Italy (Torino, Pavia and Verona) and the mutagenic properties of the PM2.5 organic extracts were assessed with the Ames test. The bacterial used in this study were three Salmonella typhimurium strains: TA98. nitroreductase-less mutant TA98NR and YG1021 carrying a nitroreductase-producing plasmid. The annual PM2.5 mean level measured in Torino was 46.5 (+/- 31.6) mu g/m(3), in Pavia 34.8 (+/- 25.1) mu g/m(3), and in Verona 37.3 (27.8) mu g/m(3), while the mutagenicity expressed as TA98 net reverants/m(3) was 28.0 (22.1), 28.3 (24.9), and 34.2 (30.9) respectively. Monthly pool bioassays, conducted with the three different strains, showed a greater mutagenic response of the YG1021 in each city. The relationship among the mutagenic answers for YG1021:TA98:TA98NR was about 6:3:1 (p $<$ 0.001). Over nitroreductase activity enhanced the response of 2.2, 2.0 and 1.7 times for Torino, Pavia, and Verona (ANOVA Torino p $<$ 0.05) respectively. Without nitroreductase activity the genotoxicity was limited. These biological findings are able to describe a relevant role played by the nitro compounds in the mutagenic properties of the urban PM2.5 in the Padana plain; moreover the bacterial nitroreductase plays a predominant role in DNA interaction primarily for Torino PM2.5 extracts.

Here we report the characterization of a novel Rieske N-oxygenase, aminopyrrolnitrin oxygenase (PrnD) that catalyzes the unusual oxidation of an arylamine to an arylnitro group. PrnD from Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf5 was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, and the activity of the purified PrnD was reconstituted, which required in vitro assembly of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster into the protein and the presence of NADPH, FMN, and an E. coli flavin reductase SsuE. Biochemical and bioinformatics studies indicated that the reconstituted PrnD contains a Rieske iron-sulfur cluster and a mononuclear iron center that are formed by residues Cys(69), Cys(88), His(71), His(91), Asp(323), His(186), and His(191), respectively. The enzyme showed a limited range of substrate specificity and catalyzed the conversion of aminopyrrolnitrin into pyrrolnitrin with K-m = 191 mu M and k(cat) = 6.8 min(-1). Isotope labeling experiments with O-18(2) and (H2O)-O-18 suggested that the oxygen atoms in the pyrrolnitrin product are derived exclusively from molecular oxygen. In addition, it was found that the oxygenation of the arylamine substrates catalyzed by PrnD occurs at the enzyme active site and does not involve free radical chain reactions. By analogy to known examples of arylamine oxidation, a catalytic mechanism for the bioconversion of amino pyrrolnitrin into pyrrolnitrin was proposed. Our results should facilitate further mechanistic and crystallographic studies of this arylamine oxygenase and may provide a new enzymatic route for the synthesis of aromatic nitro compounds from their corresponding aromatic amines.},

LTP utilizes dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) to create a low power plasma which is guided by gas flow onto the sample from which analytes are desorbed and ionized. In this study, the potential of LTP-MS for the detection of pesticide residues in food is demonstrated. Thirteen multi-class agricultural chemicals were studied (ametryn, amitraz, atrazine, buprofezin, DEET, diphenylamine, ethoxyquin, imazalil, isofenphos-methyl, isoproturon, malathion, parathion-ethyl and terbuthylazine). To evaluate the potential of the proposed approach, LTP-MS experiments were performed directly on fruit peels as well as on fruit/vegetable extracts. Most of the agrochemicals examined displayed remarkable sensitivity in the positive ion mode, giving limits of detection (LOD) for the direct measurement in the low picogram range. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was used to confirm identification of selected pesticides by using for these experiments spiked fruit/vegetable extracts (QuEChERS, a standard sample treatment protocol) at levels as low as 1 pg, absolute, for some of the analytes. Comparisons of the data obtained by direct LTP-MS were made with the slower but more accurate conventional LC-MS/MS procedure. Herbicides spiked in aqueous solutions were detectable at LODs as low as 0.5 microg L(-1) without the need for any sample preparation. The results demonstrate that ambient LTP-MS can be applied for the detection and confirmation of traces of agrochemicals in actual market-purchased produce and in natural water samples. Quantitative analysis was also performed in a few selected cases and displayed a relatively high degree of linearity over four orders of magnitude.},

The commensal yeast C. albicans is one of the main causes of nosocomial fungal infectious diseases, whereas the filamentous fungus A. fumigatus has become one of the most prevalent airborne fungal pathogens. Early diagnosis of these fungal infections is challenging, only a limited number of antifungals for treatment are available, and the molecular details of pathogenicity are hardly understood. The completion of both the A. fumigatus and C. albicans genome sequence provides the opportunity to improve diagnosis, to define new drug targets, to understand the functions of many uncharacterised proteins, and to study protein regulation on a global scale. With the application of proteomic tools, particularly two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and LC/MS-based methods, a comprehensive overview about the proteins of A. fumigatus and C. albicans present or induced during environmental changes and stress conditions has been obtained in the past 5 years. However, for the discovery of further putative virulence determinants, more sensitive and targeted proteomic methods have to be applied. Here, we review the recent proteome data generated for A. fumigatus and C. albicans that are related to factors required for pathogenicity. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The eyes absent (Eya) genes encode a family of proteins that combine the functions of transcriptional cofactors, signal transducers and enzymes, namely protein tyrosine phosphatases. The latter activity resides in the highly conserved C-terminal Eya domain (ED). Here, we investigated the substrate specificity of the Arabidopsis thaliana homologue (AtEya) by using low-molecular-weight compounds and synthetic phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing peptides that correspond either to phosphorylation sites in proteins or to peptides that were selected through the screening of a combinatorial peptide library. AtEya displayed modest peptide substrate specificity and was sensitive to charges adjacent to pY. In general, the presence of acidic residues on the N-terminal side of the phosphorylation site was critical for catalysis, whereas basic amino acids seemed to be preferred with respect to high-affinity binding. We also detected significant acyl phosphatase activity of AtEya; this suggests that Eya proteins might have further substrates in vivo. In addition, we analysed the phosphatase activity of a number of variants of the mouse Eya1 protein that harbours single point mutations that were associated with branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR), branchio-oto syndrome (BO) and ocular defects, respectively, in humans. While BOR mutations led to a significantly reduced phosphatase activity, BO mutants as well as those that are associated with ocular defects only displayed activity that was similar to wild-type levels.},

  abstract = {Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the preferred method for conducting large-scale surveys of proteomes. Automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. As most sequence search engines return results even for 'unmatchable' spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. Here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target-decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (FP) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.},

  abstract = {The secretion of proteolytic enzymes by dermatophytes is a key factor in their invasion and subsequent dissemination through the stratum corneum of the host. During the first stages of infection, dermatophytes respond to the skin by de-repressing a number of genes coding for proteins and enzymes such as adhesins, lipases, phosphatases, DNAses, non-specific proteases, and keratinases. These proteins have their optimal activity at acidic pH values, which matches the acidic pH of human skin, allowing the pathogen to adhere and penetrate the host tissue, scavenge nutrients and overcome host defence mechanisms. The conserved PacC/Rim101p signal transduction pathway mediates diverse metabolic events involved in ambient pH sensing and in the virulence of pathogenic microorganisms. The seven dermatophyte genomes analysed here revealed the presence of the PacC/Rim101p pH-responsive signal transduction pathway, which consists of the six pal genes (palA, B, C, F, H and I) and the transcription factor PacC. The PacC binding site was present in the promoter regions of pacC, palB, palI and palH genes of all dermatophytes, suggesting functional equivalency with the signalling cascade of other fungi. Moreover, the promoter region of pacC gene of the seven dermatophytes had multiple PacC DNA-binding sites, suggesting that these genes, like their homologues in model fungi, are auto-regulated.},

It is initiated at the endoplasmic reticulum by O-mannosyltransferases (PMT) that are evolutionary conserved from yeast to humans. The PMT family is phylogenetically classified into PMT1, PMT2 and PMT4 subfamilies, which differ in protein substrate specificity and number of genes per subfamily. In this study, we characterized for the first time the whole PMT family of a pathogenic filamentous fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus. Genome analysis showed that only one member of each subfamily is present in A. fumigatus, PMT1, PMT2 and PMT4. Despite the fact that all PMTs are transmembrane proteins with conserved peptide motifs, the phenotype of each PMT deletion mutant was very different in A. fumigatus. If disruption of PMT1 did not reveal any phenotype, deletion of PMT2 was lethal. Disruption of PMT4 resulted in abnormal mycelial growth and highly reduced conidiation associated to significant proteomic changes. The double pmt1pmt4 mutant was lethal. The single pmt4 mutant exhibited an exquisite sensitivity to echinocandins that is associated to major changes in the expression of signal transduction cascade genes. These results indicate that the PMT family members play a major role in growth, morphogenesis and viability of A. fumigatus.},

  abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is the common cause of allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and most of the allergens have been described from its secreted fraction. In the present investigation, germinating conidial cytosolic proteins of A. fumigatus were extracted from a 16 h culture. The proteome from this fraction was developed, and immuno-blots were generated using pooled ABPA patients' sera. Well separated Immunoglobulin-E (IgE) and Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) reactive spots were picked from corresponding 2DE gels and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. As a result, 66 immuno-reactive proteins were identified from two geographically different strains (190/96 and DAYA) of A. fumigatus. Only 3 out of 66 proteins reacted with IgG, and the remaining 63 proteins were found to be IgE reactive. These 63 IgE-reactive cytosolic proteins from germinating conidia included 2 already known (Asp f12 and Asp f22) and 4 predicted allergens (Hsp88, Hsp70, malate dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase) based on their homology with other known fungal allergens. In view of this, the panel of presently identified IgE-reactive novel proteins holds the potential of providing a basis for the wider diagnostic application in assay for allergic aspergillosis. We could demonstrate that recombinantly expressed proteins from this panel showed consistent reactivity with IgE of individual sera of ABPA patients. The recombinantly expressed proteins may also be useful in desensitization therapy of allergic disorders including ABPA.},

Using iTRAQ, a total of 471 unique proteins were identified in soluble and cell wall/plasma membrane fractions at 24 and 48 h of growth in rich media in a wild-type drug-susceptible strain. A total of 122 proteins showed at least a 2-fold change in relative abundance following exposure to caspofungin (CSF) at just below the minimum effective concentration (0.12 mu g/ml). The largest changes were seen in the mitochondrial hypoxia response domain protein (AFUA\_1G12250), the level of which decreased $>$16-fold in the secreted fraction, and ChiA1, the level of which decreased 12.1-fold in the cell wall/plasma membrane fraction. The level of the major allergen and cytotoxin AspF1 was also shown to decrease by 12.1-fold upon the addition of drug. A subsequent iTRAQ analysis of an echinocandin-resistant strain (fks1-S678P) was used to validate proteins specific to drug action. A total of 103 proteins in the 2 fractions tested by iTRAQ were differentially expressed in the wild-type susceptible strain but not significantly changed in the resistant strain. Of these potential biomarkers, 11 had levels that changed at least 12-fold. Microarray analysis of the susceptible strain was performed to evaluate the correlation between proteomics and genomics, with a total of 117 genes found to be changing at least 2-fold. Of these, a total of 22 proteins with significant changes identified by iTRAQ also showed significant gene expression level changes by microarray. Overall, these data have the potential to identify biomarkers that assess the relative efficacy of echinocandin drug therapy.},

In addition, the effects of the ES emitter distance to the inlet, solution flow rate, and inlet temperature were characterized. Quantitative measurements of ES current loss throughout the ESI interface were accomplished by electrically isolating the front surface of the interface from the inner wall of the heated inlet capillary, enabling losses on the two surfaces to be distinguished. In addition, the ES current lost to the front surface of the ESI interface was spatially profiled with a linear array of 340-microm-diameter electrodes placed adjacent to the inlet capillary entrance. Current transmitted as gas-phase ions was differentiated from charged droplets and solvent clusters by measuring sensitivity with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The study revealed a large sampling efficiency into the inlet capillary ($>$90\% at an emitter distance of 1 mm), a global rather than a local gas dynamic effect on the shape of the ES plume resulting from the gas flow conductance limit of the inlet capillary, a large ($>$80\%) loss of analyte ions after transmission through the inlet arising from incomplete desolvation at a solution flow rate of 1.0 microL/min, and a decrease in analyte ions peak intensity at lower temperatures, despite a large increase in ES current transmission efficiency.},

Attempts made in past for recombinant expression of plant catalase in Escherichia coli consistently resulted in formation of insoluble and inactive aggregates of inclusion body. Here we have shown the specific requirement of a thioredoxin fusion partner, the involvement of trigger factor protein and the low temperature treatment during induction period for synthesis of completely solubilized rice plant catalase-A in recombinant E. coli. Furthermore, the bacteria required the supplementation of $\delta$-aminolevulinic acid to produce bio-active recombinant rice catalase-A. The molecular and biochemical properties of the purified recombinant protein showed the characteristic features of a typical mono-functional plant catalase. These results attest to the usefulness of the present protocol for production of plant catalase using E. coli as heterologous expression system.},

The channels that convey signals of change from the global to the local may also work in reverse, connecting the responses and choices of households in one geographic context to outcomes and choices of other households in quite distant places. We draw from recent case studies of farm-level vulnerability and livelihood security in Mexico and Vietnam to demonstrate that coffee smallholders' independent responses to the risks and opportunities associated with global scale economic and environmental change, are teleconnected and thus can create feedbacks which in turn affect the present and future vulnerabilities of other smallholders around the globe.},

In this study, we report that different recombinant Saps, including Sap1, Sap2, Sap3, and Sap6, have differing abilities to induce secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by human monocytes. In particular Sap1, Sap2, and Sap6 significantly induced interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-6 production. Sap3 was able to stimulate the secretion of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. All Saps tested were able to induce Ca(2+) influx in monocytes. Treatment of these Saps with pepstatin A did not have any effect on cytokine secretion, indicating that their stimulatory potential was independent from their proteolytic activity. The capacity of Saps to induce inflammatory cytokine production was also independent from protease-activated receptor (PAR) activation and from the optimal pH for individual Sap activity. The interaction of Saps with monocytes induced Akt activation and phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha, which mediates translocation of NF-kappa B into the nucleus. Overall, these results suggest that individual Sap proteins can induce an inflammatory response and that this phenomenon is independent from the pH of a specific host niche and from Sap enzymatic activity. The inflammatory response is partially dependent on Sap denaturation and is triggered by the Akt/NF-kappa B activation pathway. Our data suggest a novel, activity-independent aspect of Saps during interactions of C. albicans with the host.},

In this work we introduce the first open source structure generator, Open Molecule Generator (OMG), which for a given elemental composition produces all non-isomorphic chemical structures that match that elemental composition. Furthermore, this structure generator can accept as additional input one or multiple non-overlapping prescribed substructures to drastically reduce the number of possible chemical structures. Being open source allows for customization and future extension of its functionality. OMG relies on a modified version of the Canonical Augmentation Path, which grows intermediate chemical structures by adding bonds and checks that at each step only unique molecules are produced. In order to benchmark the tool, we generated chemical structures for the elemental formulas and substructures of different metabolites and compared the results with a commercially available structure generator. The results obtained, i.e. the number of molecules generated, were identical for elemental compositions having only C, O and H. For elemental compositions containing C, O, H, N, P and S, OMG produces all the chemically valid molecules while the other generator produces more, yet chemically impossible, molecules. The chemical completeness of the OMG results comes at the expense of being slower than the commercial generator. In addition to being open source, OMG clearly showed the added value of constraining the solution space by using multiple prescribed substructures as input. We expect this structure generator to be useful in many fields, but to be especially of great importance for metabolomics, where identifying unknown metabolites is still a major bottleneck.},

In the present study, Brazilian green and roasted coffee beans were investigated for possible correlations between cup quality and the levels of sucrose, caffeine, trigonelline and chlorogenic acids, determined by HPLC analysis. Trigonelline and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid levels in green and roasted coffee correlated strongly with high quality. To a lesser extent, caffeine levels were also associated with good quality. On the other hand, the amount of defective beans, the levels of caffeoylquinic acids (predominantly 5-caffeoyilquinic acid), feruloylquinic acids, and their oxidation products were associated with poor cup quality and with the Rio-off-flavor. The fact that similar correlations between cup quality and chemical attributes were observed in green and light roasted samples \textendash{} the latter used for coffee cup classification \textendash{} indicates that chemical analysis of green beans may be used as an additional tool for coffee quality evaluation.},

  abstract = {Background: Burkholderia rhizoxinica is an intracellular symbiont of the phytopathogenic zygomycete Rhizopus microsporus, the causative agent of rice seedling blight. The endosymbiont produces the antimitotic macrolide rhizoxin for its host. It is vertically transmitted within vegetative spores and is essential for spore formation of the fungus. To shed light on the evolution and genetic potential of this model organism, we analysed the whole genome of B. rhizoxinica HKI 0454 - a type strain of endofungal Burkholderia species. Results: The genome consists of a structurally conserved chromosome and two plasmids. Compared to free-living Burkholderia species, the genome is smaller in size and harbors less transcriptional regulator genes. Instead, we observed accumulation of transposons over the genome. Prediction of primary metabolic pathways and transporters suggests that endosymbionts consume host metabolites like citrate, but might deliver some amino acids and cofactors to the host. The rhizoxin biosynthesis gene cluster shows evolutionary traces of horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, we analysed gene clusters coding for nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). Notably, B. rhizoxinica lacks common genes which are dedicated to quorum sensing systems, but is equipped with a large number of virulence-related factors and putative type III effectors. Conclusions: B. rhizoxinica is the first endofungal bacterium, whose genome has been sequenced. Here, we present models of evolution, metabolism and tools for host-symbiont interaction of the endofungal bacterium deduced from whole genome analyses. Genome size and structure suggest that B. rhizoxinica is in an early phase of adaptation to the intracellular lifestyle (genome in transition). By analysis of tranporters and metabolic pathways we predict how metabolites might be exchanged between the symbiont and its host. Gene clusters for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites represent novel targets for genomic mining of cryptic natural products. In silico analyses of virulence-associated genes, secreted proteins and effectors might inspire future studies on molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial-fungal interaction.},

We hypothesized that exposure of the fungal pathogen to human serum would lead to significant alterations to the organism's physiology, including metabolic activity and stress response. Shifts in functional pathway and corresponding enzyme reactivity of A. fumigatus upon exposure to the human host may represent much needed prognostic indicators of fungal infection. To address this, we employed a multiplexed activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) approach coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to measure broad enzyme reactivity of the fungus cultured with and without human serum. ABPP showed a shift from aerobic respiration to ethanol fermentation and utilization over time in the presence of human serum, which was not observed in serum-free culture. Our approach provides direct insight into this pathogen's ability to survive, adapt, and proliferate. Additionally, our multiplexed ABPP approach captured a broad swath of enzyme reactivity and functional pathways and provides a method for rapid assessment of the A. fumigatus response to external stimuli.},

Calcineurin is a serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase heterodimer consisting of a catalytic subunit A and a regulatory subunit B. A mutant of Aspergillus fumigatus lacking the calcineurin A (calA) catalytic subunit exhibited defective hyphal morphology related to apical extension and branching growth, which resulted in drastically decreased filamentation. Here, we investigated which pathways are influenced by A. fumigatus calcineurin during proliferation by comparatively determining the transcriptional profile of A. fumigatus wild type and Delta calA mutant strains. Our results showed that the mitochondrial copy number is reduced in the Delta calA mutant strain, and the mutant has increased alternative oxidase (aoxA) mRNA accumulation and activity. Furthermore, we identified four genes that encode transcription factors that have increased mRNA expression in the Delta calA mutant. Deletion mutants for these transcription factors had reduced susceptibility to itraconazole, caspofungin, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Furthermore, two novel eukaryotic elongation factor proteins (eEF1B gamma), termed E1fA and B have been identified and phylogenetically confirmed to belong to the eEF1B gamma class of GST-like proteins. One of these proteins (E1fA) has been purified to homogeneity, identified as a monomeric enzyme (molecular mass = 20 kDa; pI = 5.9 and 6.5), and found to exhibit glutathione transferase activity specific activities (mean standard deviation, n = 3) of 3.13 +/- 0.27 and 3.43 +/- 1.0 mu mol/min/mg, using CDNB and ethacrynic acid, respectively.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is an important analytical technology for e.g. metabolomics experiments. Determining the boundaries, centres and intensities of the two-dimensional signals in the LC/MS raw data is called feature detection. For the subsequent analysis of complex samples such as plant extracts, which may contain hundreds of compounds, corresponding to thousands of features -- a reliable feature detection is mandatory.
RESULTS: We developed a new feature detection algorithm centWave for high-resolution LC/MS data sets, which collects regions of interest (partial mass traces) in the raw-data, and applies continuous wavelet transformation and optionally Gauss-fitting in the chromatographic domain. We evaluated our feature detection algorithm on dilution series and mixtures of seed and leaf extracts, and estimated recall, precision and F-score of seed and leaf specific features in two experiments of different complexity.
CONCLUSION: The new feature detection algorithm meets the requirements of current metabolomics experiments. centWave can detect close-by and partially overlapping features and has the highest overall recall and precision values compared to the other algorithms, matchedFilter (the original algorithm of XCMS) and the centroidPicker from MZmine. The centWave algorithm was integrated into the Bioconductor R-package XCMS and is available from (http://www.bioconductor.org/).},

  abstract = {Candida albicans is a commensal organism, but causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. Certain factors such as yeast-hyphae transition and hydrolytic enzymes are suggested as virulence attributes of C. albicans. Among them, 10 types of secreted aspartic protease (SAP) genes have received particular attention as a major virulence gene family. However, their full functional repertoire, including its biochemical properties, remains to be elucidated. Hence, we purified all Sap isozymes using Pichia pastoris and comprehensively determined and compared their biochemical properties. While optimum pH of Sap7 was 6.5 and that of Sap8 was 2.5, presence of other Sap isozymes functioning within a broad range of optimum pH could allow C. albicans to survive and cause infections in various tissues. The substrate specificities of Sap isozymes were analysed by using FRETS-25Xaa libraries. Sap7 and Sap10 showed high substrate specificity, while other Sap isozymes had broad substrate specificities. Principal component analysis revealed that the 10 Sap isozymes were clustered into 3 distinct groups in terms of their substrate specificities. Interestingly, Sap4-6, which are coproduced in the hyphal form, were clustered as the same group, indicating that they may target similar host proteins. These results will lead to further understanding of C. albicans pathogenicity.},

  abstract = {In fungi, nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRP synthetases) are large multi-functional enzymes containing adenylation, thiolation (or peptidyl carrier protein, PCP) and condensation domains. These enzymes are often encoded within gene clusters. Multiple NRP synthetase ORFs have also been identified in fungi (14 in Aspergillus fumigatus). LeaA, a methyltransferase, is involved in secondary metabolite gene cluster regulation in Aspergillus spp. The NRP synthetases GliP and FtmA respectively direct the biosynthesis of the toxic metabolites gliotoxin and brevianamide F, a precursor of bioactive prenylated alkaloids. The NRP synthetase Pes1 has been shown to mediate resistance to oxidative stress, and in plant-pathogenic ascomycetes (e.g. Cochliobolus heterostrophus) an NRP synthetase, encoded by the NPS6 gene, significantly contributes to virulence and resistance to oxidative stress. Adenylation (A) domains within NRP synthetases govern the specificity of amino acid incorporation into nonribosomally synthesized peptides. To date there have only been limited demonstrations of A domain specificity (e.g. A. fumigatus GliP and in Beauveria bassiana) in fungi. Indeed, only in silico prediction data are available on A domain specificity of NRP synthetases; from most fungi. NRP synthetases are activated by 4'-phosphopantetheinylation of serine residues within PCP domains by 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferases (4'-PPTases). Coenzyme A acts as the 4'-phosphopantetheine donor, and labelled coenzyme A can be used to affinity-label apo-NRP synthetases. Emerging fungal gene disruption and gene cluster expression strategies, allied to proteomic strategies, are poised to facilitate a greater understanding of the coding potential of NRP synthetases in fungi.},

  abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) that harbour oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) are biologically distinct and have a better prognosis. This information is a persuasive argument for the identification of these cancers in clinical practice. The concept of `HPV related' SCC should be underpinned by knowledge that the malignant cells harbour a high risk HPV genotype and there is evidence of oncogenic viral protein expression with effects on cell signalling pathways. For satisfactory classification in clinical practice HPV tests should reliably work on fixed cells and tissue. There is evidence that detection of high risk HPV by consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) alone is insufficient to accurately classify tumours. However, there is convincing evidence that the detection of p16 protein by immunohistochemistry can be used as a surrogate marker for the elaboration of oncogenic HPV proteins. Recently, there have been calls for standardisation of HPV testing in head and neck cancers and two diagnostic algorithms have emerged: the first advocates screening for p16 by immunohistochemistry followed by detection of HPV DNA by in situ hybridisation: the second recommends detection of p16 followed by consensus PCR. The majority of pathology laboratories have the capability of delivering the first algorithm. Furthermore, the techniques employed are automated and are subject to stringent quality assurance measures; features that can deliver routine, accurate and cost effective HPV testing for oropharyngeal cancers.

In contrast to ?aoxA, ?cycA was found to be significantly impaired in conidia germination, growth in normoxia and hypoxia, and displayed attenuated virulence. Intriguingly, loss of cycA results in increased levels of AoxA activity, which results in increased resistance to oxidative stress, macrophage killing and long-term persistence in murine lungs.

  abstract = {Mass spectrometric imaging allows the investigation of the spatial distribution of molecules at complex surfaces. The combination of molecular speciation with local analysis renders a chemical microscope that can be used for the direct biomolecular characterization of histological tissue surfaces. MS based imaging advantageously allows label-free detection and mapping of a wide-range of biological compounds whose presence or absence can be the direct result of disease pathology. Successful detection of the analytes of interest at the desired spatial resolution requires careful attention to several steps in the mass spectrometry imaging protocol. This review will describe and discuss a selected number of crucial developments in ionization, instrumentation, and application of this innovative technology. The focus of this review is on the latest developments in imaging MS. Selected biological applications are employed to illustrate some of the novel features discussed. Two commonly used MS imaging techniques, secondary ion mass spectrometric (SIMS) imaging and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometric imaging, center this review. New instrumental developments are discussed that extend spatial resolution, mass resolving power, mass accuracy, tandem-MS capabilities, and offer new gas-phase separation capabilities for both imaging techniques. It will be shown how the success of MS imaging is crucially dependent on sample preparation protocols as they dictate the nature and mass range of detected biomolecules that can be imaged. Finally, developments in data analysis strategies for large imaging datasets will be briefly discussed.},

In Asian countries, the fermentation of soy beans and tofu for tempe and sufu production with various Rhizopus strains is widespread. Here we report the finding of toxinogenic bacteria in a starter culture used for sufu production. By means of metabolic profiling of the fungus under standard conditions for tempe and sufu production, we found that toxins of the rhizoxin complex are produced in critical amounts. Considering that rhizoxins are severe toxins with strong antimitotic activity it is important to notice that our findings uncover a health-threatening symbiosis in food processing. A simple PCR method for detecting toxinogenic endofungal bacteria in starter cultures is proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The proteome of Aspergillus fumigatus was developed after treatment with sublethal doses of compound and analyzed. The results demonstrated 143 differentially expressed proteins on treatment with SCD-1. The expression of four proteins, namely cell division control protein, ubiquitin-like activating enzyme, vacuolar ATP synthase catalytic subunit A, and UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase of A. fumigatus, was completely inhibited, whereas there were 13 newly expressed and 96 overexpressed proteins, mainly belonging to stress pathway. The treatment of A. fumigatus with SCD-1 also led to attenuation of proteins involved in cell replication and other important biosynthetic processes, including riboflavin biosynthesis, which has been pathogen-specific. In addition to key enzymatic players and antioxidants, nine hypothetical proteins were also identified, seven of which have been novel, being described for the first time. As no cellular functions have yet been described for these hypothetical proteins, their alteration in response to SCD-1 provides significant information about their putative roles in pathogen defense.},

  abstract = {Background: Aspergillus fumigatus is a thermotolerant human-pathogenic mold and the most common cause of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients. Its predominance is based on several factors most of which are still unknown. The thermotolerance of A. fumigatus is one of the traits which have been assigned to pathogenicity. It allows the fungus to grow at temperatures up to and above that of a fevered human host. To elucidate the mechanisms of heat resistance, we analyzed the change of the A. fumigatus proteome during a temperature shift from 30 degrees C to 48 degrees C by 2D-fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE). To improve 2D gel image analysis results, protein spot quantitation was optimized by missing value imputation and normalization. Differentially regulated proteins were compared to previously published transcriptome data of A. fumigatus. The study was augmented by bioinformatical analysis of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the promoter region of genes whose corresponding proteins were differentially regulated upon heat shock. Results: 91 differentially regulated protein spots, representing 64 different proteins, were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). They showed a continuous up-, down-or an oscillating regulation. Many of the identified proteins were involved in protein folding (chaperones), oxidative stress response, signal transduction, transcription, translation, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism. A correlation between alteration of transcript levels and corresponding proteins was detected for half of the differentially regulated proteins. Interestingly, some previously undescribed putative targets for the heat shock regulator Hsf1 were identified. This provides evidence for Hsf1-dependent regulation of mannitol biosynthesis, translation, cytoskeletal dynamics and cell division in A. fumigatus. Furthermore, computational analysis of promoters revealed putative binding sites for an AP-2alpha-like transcription factor upstream of some heat shock induced genes. Until now, this factor has only been found in vertebrates. Conclusions: Our newly established DIGE data analysis workflow yields improved data quality and is widely applicable for other DIGE datasets. Our findings suggest that the heat shock response in A. fumigatus differs from already well-studied yeasts and other filamentous fungi.},

  abstract = {A new technique for generating pH gradients in isoelectric focusing is described, based on the principle that the buffering groups are covalently linked to the matrix used as anticonvective medium. For the generation of this type of pH gradient in polyacrylamide gels, a set of buffering monomers, called Immobiline (in analogy with Ampholine), is used. The pH gradient gels are cast in the same way as pore gradient gels, but instead of varying the acrylamide content, the light and heavy solutions are adjusted to different pH values with the aid of the Immobiline buffers. Available Immobiline species make it possible to generate any narrow linear pH gradient between pH 3 and 10. The behaviour of these types of gradients in isoelectric focusing is described. Immobilized pH gradients show a number of advantages compared with carrier ampholyte generated pH gradients. The most important are: (1) the cathodic drift is completely abolished; (2) they give higher resolution and higher loading capacity; (3) they have uniform conductivity and buffering capacity; (4) they represent a milieu of known and controlled ionic strength.},

However, the functionality of these central pathways in strain LB400 has not been assessed and related peripheral pathways has not been described. Methodology/Principal Findings: The aims of this study were to determine the functionality of the homogentisate and homoprotocatechuate central pathways in B. xenovorans LB400 and to establish their role in 3-hydroxyphenylacetate (3-HPA) and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (4-HPA) catabolism. Strain LB400 was able to grow using 3-HPA and 4-HPA as sole carbon source. A genomic search in LB400 suggested the presence of mhaAB and hpaBC genes clusters encoding proteins of the 3-hydroxyphenylacetate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate peripheral pathways. LB400 cells grown with 3-HPA and 4-HPA degraded homogentisate and homoprotocatechuate and showed homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase and homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase activities. Transcriptional analyses by RT-PCR showed the expression of two chromosomally-encoded homogentisate dioxygenases (BxeA2725 and BxeA3900) and the hpaD gene encoding the homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase during 3-HPA and 4-HPA degradation. The proteome analyses by two-dimensional polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis of B. xenovorans LB400 grown in 3-HPA and 4-HPA showed the induction of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase HmgB (BxeA3899). Conclusions/Significance: This study revealed that strain LB400 used both homogentisate and homoprotocatechuate ring-cleavage pathways for 3-hydroxyphenylacetate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate catabolism and that these four catabolic routes are functional, confirming the metabolic versatility of B. xenovorans LB400.},

It belongs to the family of class III plant peroxidases that can oxidize a wide variety of organic and inorganic substrates using hydrogen peroxide. Because the plant enzyme is a heterogeneous glycoprotein, SBP was produced recombinant in Escherichia coli for the present crystallographic study. The three-dimensional structure of SBP shows a bound tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane molecule (TRIS). This TRIS molecule has hydrogen bonds to active site residues corresponding to the residues that interact with the small phenolic substrate ferulic acid in the horseradish peroxidase C (HRPC):ferulic acid complex. TRIS is positioned in what has been described as a secondary substrate-binding site in HRPC, and the structure of the SBP:TRIS complex indicates that this secondary substrate-binding site could be of functional importance. SBP has one of the most solvent accessible delta-meso haem edge (the site of electron transfer from reducing substrates to the enzymatic intermediates compound I and II) so far described for a plant peroxidase and structural alignment suggests that the volume of Ile74 is a factor that influences the solvent accessibility of this important site. A contact between haem C8 vinyl and the sulphur atom of Met37 is observed in the SBP structure. This interaction might affect the stability of the haem group by stabilisation/delocalisation of the porphyrin pi-cation of compound I.},

  abstract = {Caffeine and trigonelline are major nitrogenous alkaloids found in coffee seeds. Accumulation of these alkaloids in two cultivars of Coffea arabica and in a cultivar of Coffea canephora seeds was monitored. Growth stages are specified by letters, A to G. They correspond to the pinhead and small (A), rapid expansion and pericarp growth (B), endosperm formation (C), early dry matter accumulation (D), mature (green) (E), ripening (pink) (F) and fully ripened (red) (G) stages. Caffeine and trigonelline content increased at stages D and E. The concentrations of caffeine in ripe seeds (stage G) of the two cultivars of C. arabica and C. canephora seeds were respectively 1.0\% and 1.9\% dry weight. A high biosynthetic activity of caffeine, which was estimated via the incorporation of [8-14C]adenine into purine alkaloids, was found in whole fruits (perisperm and pericarp) in stages B and C, and in developing seeds (endosperm) in stages D and E. The biosynthetic activities of caffeine were reduced in both pericarp and seeds in stages F and G. In C. arabica cv. Mokka and in C. canephora, the transcripts of CmXRS1, CTS2 and CCS1, three N-methyltransferase genes for caffeine biosynthesis, and of methionine synthase gene (MS) were detected in every stage of growth, although the amounts of these transcripts were significantly less in stage G. The pattern of expression of genes for caffeine synthesis during growth is roughly related to the in situ synthesis of caffeine from adenine nucleotides, although exceptions were found in the very early and later stages of fruit growth. The amounts of the transcripts of CmXRS1, CTS2 and CCS1 were higher in seeds than in pericarp, but reverse was true for MS transcripts in developing coffee fruits. Similarly, caffeine synthase (N3-methyltransferase) activity was also higher in seeds than in pericarp. Concentrations of trigonelline in ripe seeds (stage G) of C. arabica cv. Mokka, C. arabica cv. Catimor and C. canephora were ca. 1.3\%, 1.0\% and 1.4\% of dry weight, respectively. High biosynthetic activity of trigonelline was found in young fruits (stages A\textendash{}C) and in the pericarp of developing fruits (stage E). The biosynthetic activity was reduced markedly in seeds at stages F and G. These results suggest that active trigonelline biosynthesis occurs in the pericarp of coffee fruits. Although the final concentration of caffeine and trigonelline varies in the three Coffea plants, the patterns of fluctuations of the caffeine and trigonelline biosynthetic activity in all Coffea plants are all similar.},

By linking peaks, we can locate multiple-charge peaks at the correct position in the spectrum, we can deconvolute complex regions with many overlapping peaks by including information from related regions with lower complexity and higher resolution, and we reduce the total number of observed peaks in a spectrum to a much smaller number of underlying molecular species. In this paper we properly model 29 952 peaks in 64 spectra, using only 39 location parameters and one shape parameter. This major reduction from many different molecules to a limited set of molecular species reduces the statistical test multiplicity for biomarker discovery and therefore we imply that the reduction should eventually increase the biomarker discovery power significantly, too.},

  abstract = {Traditional storage practices in developing countries cannot guarantee protection against major storage pests of staple food crops like maize, leading to 20\textendash{}30\% grain losses, particularly due to post-harvest insect pests and grain pathogens. As a result, smallholder farmers end up selling their grain soon after harvest, only to buy it back at an expensive price just a few months after harvest, falling in a poverty trap. The potential impact on poverty reduction and greater livelihood security will not be realized, however, if farmers are unable to store grains and sell surplus production at attractive prices. Apart from causing quantitative losses, pests in stored grain are also linked to aflatoxin contamination and poisoning. To address this problem, a metal silo was developed as a valid option and proven effective in protecting stored grains from attack by storage insect pests. A metal silo is a cylindrical structure, constructed from a galvanized iron sheet and hermetically sealed, killing any insect pests that may be present. The impact of metal silo technology in Africa, Asia and Latin America includes, improving food security, empowering smallholder farmers, enhancing income opportunities and job creation, and safeguarding the agro-ecosystems. The metal silo can be fabricated in different sizes, 100~kg\textendash{}3000~kg holding capacity by trained local artisans, with the corresponding prices of \$35 to \$375. The use of metal silo, therefore, should be encouraged in order to prevent storage losses and enhance food security in developing countries.},

  abstract = {Polyketide-derived pyrones are structurally diverse secondary metabolites that are represented in all three kingdoms of life and are endowed with various biological functions. The aureothin family of Streptomyces metabolites was chosen as a model to study the factors governing structural diversity and the evolutionary processes involved. This review highlights recent insights into the non-colinear aureothin and neoaureothin modular type I polyketide synthase (PKS), aromatic starter unit biosynthesis, polyketide tailoring reactions, and a non-enzymatic polyene splicing cascade. Pyrone biosynthesis in bacteria, fungi, and plants is compared. Finally, various strategies to increase metabolic diversity of aureothin derivatives through mutasynthesis, pathway engineering, and biotransformation are presented. The unusual aureothin and neoaureothin assembly lines thus not only represent a model for PKS evolution, but provided important insights into non-canonical enzymatic processes that could be employed for the production of antitumor and antifungal agents.

  abstract = {Interactions between bacteria and fungi are well known, but it is often underestimated how intimate and decisive such associations can be with respect to behaviour and survival of each participating organism. In this article we review recent advances in molecular bacterium-fungus interactions, combining the data of different model systems. Emphasis is given to the positive or negative consequences these interactions have on the microbe accommodating plants and animals. Intricate mechanisms of antagonism and tolerance have emerged, being as important for the biological control of plants against fungal diseases as for the human body against fungal infections. Bacterial growth promoters of fungal mycelium have been characterized, and these may as well assist plant-fungus mutualism as disease development in animals. Some of the toxins that have been previously associated with fungi are actually produced by endobacteria, and the mechanisms that lie behind the maintenance of such exquisite endosymbioses are fascinating. Bacteria do cause diseases in fungi, and a synergistic action between bacterial toxins and extracellular enzymes is the hallmark of such diseases. The molecular study of bacterium-fungus associations has expanded our view on microbial communication, and this promising field shows now great potentials in medicinal, agricultural and biotechnological applications.},

  abstract = {Our previous work postulated a transition concept among different isotopic mass states (i.e., isotopic species) of a molecule, and developed a hierarchical algorithm for accurately calculating their masses and abundances. A theoretical mass spectrum can be generated by convoluting a peak shape function to these discrete mass states. This approach suffers from limited memory if a level in the hierarchical structure has too many mass states. Here we present a memory efficient divide-and-recursively-combine algorithm to do the calculation, which also improves the truncation method used in the previous hierarchical algorithm. Instead of treating all of the elements in a molecule as a whole, the new algorithm first 'strips' each element one by one. For the mass states of each element, a hierarchical structure is established and kept in the memory. This process reduces the memory usage by orders of magnitude (e.g., for bovine insulin, memory can be reduced from gigabytes to kilobytes). Next, a recursive algorithm is applied to combine mass states of elements to mass states of the whole molecule. The algorithm described above has been implemented as a computer program called Isotope Calculator, which was written in C++.

The function of many NF-Y subunits, mostly of the A and B type, has been studied in plants, but knowledge regarding the C subunit remains fragmentary. Here, a water stress-induced NF-YC gene from Amaranthus hypochondriacus (AhNF-YC) was further characterized by its overexpression in transgenic Arabidospis thaliana plants. A role in development was inferred from modified growth rates in root, rosettes and inflorescences recorded in AhNF-YC overexpressing Arabidopsis plants, in addition to a delayed onset of flowering. Also, the overexpression of AhNF-YC caused increased seedling sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA), and influenced the expression of several genes involved in secondary metabolism, development and ABA-related responses. An altered expression of the latter in water stressed and recovered transgenic plants, together with the observed increase in ABA sensitivity, suggested that their increased water stress resistance was partly ABA-dependent. An untargeted metabolomic analysis also revealed an altered metabolite pattern, both in normal and water stress/recovery conditions. These results suggest that AhNF-YC may play an important regulatory role in both development and stress, and represents a candidate gene for the engineering of abiotic stress resistance in commercial crops.},

Despite of this, little is known about their bacteriocyte-associated endosymbionts, which are generally important for the biology and ecology of plant sap-sucking insects. Here, we investigated the adelgid species complexes Adelges laricis/tardus, Adelges abietis/viridis and Adelges cooleyi/coweni, identified based on their coI and ef1alpha genes. Each of these insect groups harboured two phylogenetically different bacteriocyte-associated symbionts belonging to the Betaproteobacteria and the Gammaproteobacteria, respectively, as inferred from phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences and demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The betaproteobacterial symbionts of all three adelgid complexes (Candidatus Vallotia tarda, Candidatus Vallotia virida and Candidatus Vallotia cooleyia) share a common ancestor and show a phylogeny congruent with that of their respective hosts. Similarly, there is evidence for co-evolution between the gammaproteobacterial symbionts (Candidatus Profftia tarda, Candidatus Profftia virida) and A. laricis/tardus and A. abietis/viridis. In contrast, the gammaproteobacterial symbiont of A. cooleyi/coweni (Candidatus Gillettellia cooleyia) is different from that of the other two adelgids but shows a moderate relationship to the symbiont Candidatus Ecksteinia adelgidicola of A. nordmannianae/piceae. All symbionts were present in all adelgid populations and life stages analysed, suggesting vertical transmission from mother to offspring. In sharp contrast to their sister group, the aphids, adelgids do not consistently contain a single obligate (primary) symbiont but have acquired phylogenetically different bacterial symbionts during their evolution, which included multiple infections and symbiont replacement.},

  abstract = {The opportunistic human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is able to produce the dark brown pigment pyomelanin by degradation of L-tyrosine. Pyomelanin was shown to protect the fungus against reactive oxygen intermediates as well as cell wall disturbing compounds and is therefore assumed to protect against immune effector cells during the infection process. Several genes for tyrosine degradation and pyomelanin formation are organized in a cluster in the genome of A. fumigatus. Here, we aimed at further analyzing tyrosine degradation and a possible role of pyomelanin in virulence. For this purpose, the function of two not yet characterized genes of the cluster, i.e., hmgX and hmgR, was analyzed. Generation of corresponding gene deletion mutants and reconstituted strains revealed that hmgX and hmgR are essential for tyrosine degradation. Both mutants, Delta hmgX and Delta hmgR, were not able to use tyrosine as sole carbon or nitrogen source and revealed impaired pyomelanin production. HmgR harbors a Zn(II)2Cys6-DNA binding domain. Analyses of the steady state mRNA levels revealed that HmgR acts as a transcriptional activator for the genes of the tyrosine degradation cluster. Consistently, an HmgR-eGFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of A. fumigatus cells. By contrast, HmgX was found to be localized in the cytoplasm and does not contribute to regulation of gene transcription. HPLC analyses showed that HmgX is crucial for the conversion of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisic acid, the main intermediate in pyomelanin formation. Thus, HmgX is supposed to function as an accessory factor to mediate specific activity of HppD. Remarkably, the ability to degrade tyrosine and to form pyomelanin is dispensable for virulence of A. fumigatus in a murine infection model.},

ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 ribosomal DNA and partial regions of beta-tubulin and laccase lac3-1 gene were sequenced. Phylogenetic trees inferred from these sequences clearly differentiated the group of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus strains from the group of Pycnoporus puniceus strains into strongly supported clades (100\% bootstrap value). Molecular clustering based on lac 3-1 sequences enabled the distribution of Pycnoporus sanguineus and Pycnoporus coccineus through four distinct, well supported clades and sub-clades. A neotropical sub-clade, grouping the P. sanguineus strains from French Guiana and Venezuela, corresponded to P. sanguineus sensu stricto. A paleotropical sub-clade, clustering the strains from Madagascar, Vietnam and New Caledonia, was defined as Pycnoporus cf. sanguineus. The Australian clade corresponded to P. coccineus sensu stricto. The Eastern Asian region clade, clustering the strains from China and Japan, formed a P. coccineus-like group.

At the genomic level, an association between broad-scale genetic changes and the emergences of the parasitic and symbiotic life style in fungi has been proposed. Although comparative genomic studies in fungi are still in the early stages, they have enormous potential to improve our understanding of how such life styles evolve. In this chapter, we review the main characteristics of genome evolution in fungi, particularly in species that are pathogenic or symbiotic with plants, by focusing on the mechanisms involved in host interactions. We address the following topics in relation to the pathogenic and symbiotic lifestyles in fungi: the evolution of genome organization, chromosomal rearrangements, evolution of gene families and clusters, suppression of recombination around mating type loci, rapidly evolving genes, horizontal transfer, hybridization, transposable elements, telomeres, introns, mitochondrial genomes, and we finally compare genome evolution between pathogenic bacteria and fungi.},

  abstract = {Nitroaromatic compounds are relatively rare in nature and have been introduced into the environment mainly by human activities. This important class of industrial chemicals is widely used in the synthesis of many diverse products, including dyes, polymers, pesticides, and explosives. Unfortunately, their extensive use has led to environmental contamination of soil and groundwater. The nitro group, which provides chemical and functional diversity in these molecules, also contributes to the recalcitrance of these compounds to biodegradation. The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, in concert with the stability of the benzene ring, makes nitroaromatic compounds resistant to oxidative degradation. Recalcitrance is further compounded by their acute toxicity, mutagenicity, and easy reduction into carcinogenic aromatic amines. Nitroaromatic compounds are hazardous to human health and are registered on the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's list of priority pollutants for environmental remediation. Although the majority of these compounds are synthetic in nature, microorganisms in contaminated environments have rapidly adapted to their presence by evolving new biodegradation pathways that take advantage of them as sources of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. This review provides an overview of the synthesis of both man-made and biogenic nitroaromatic compounds, the bacteria that have been identified to grow on and completely mineralize nitroaromatic compounds, and the pathways that are present in these strains. The possible evolutionary origins of the newly evolved pathways are also discussed.},

Here, we describe an algorithm that automatically minimizes the standard deviation in a series of related ion peaks with varying numbers of charges. The algorithm assumes that the mass is invariant and allows the determination of the correct charge state in a peak series. The analysis results in a periodic pattern, which can be interpreted as a harmonic oscillator, when the minimum standard deviation of a charge state series is found. We observed that a mass resolution of much less than 1000 in the acquired mass spectra is sufficient to achieve a correct charge state assignment. Moreover, the boundaries of mixed species can be identified by examining the loss of periodicity in the pattern of the analysis. We tested our algorithm successfully on novel spectra and on spectra reported in the literature with sample masses up to several million Dalton, e.g., viral particles, polyethylene glycol polymers, and polystyrene nanoparticles.},

  title = {The Structure of Apo and Holo Forms of Xylose Reductase, a Dimeric Aldo-Keto Reductase from {{Candida}} Tenuis},
  volume = {41},
  issn = {0006-2960},
  abstract = {Xylose reductase is a homodimeric oxidoreductase dependent on NADPH or NADH and belongs to the largely monomeric aldo-keto reductase superfamily of proteins. It catalyzes the first step in the assimilation of xylose, an aldose found to be a major constituent monosaccharide of renewable plant hemicellulosic material, into yeast metabolic pathways. It does this by reducing open chain xylose to xylitol, which is reoxidized to xylulose by xylitol dehydrogenase and metabolically integrated via the pentose phosphate pathway. No structure has yet been determined for a xylose reductase, a dimeric aldo-keto reductase or a family 2 aldo-keto reductase. The structures of the Candida tenuis xylose reductase apo- and holoenzyme, which crystallize in spacegroup C2 with different unit cells, have been determined to 2.2 A resolution and an R-factor of 17.9 and 20.8\%, respectively. Residues responsible for mediating the novel dimeric interface include Asp-178, Arg-181, Lys-202, Phe-206, Trp-313, and Pro-319. Alignments with other superfamily members indicate that these interactions are conserved in other dimeric xylose reductases but not throughout the remainder of the oligomeric aldo-keto reductases, predicting alternate modes of oligomerization for other families. An arrangement of side chains in a catalytic triad shows that Tyr-52 has a conserved function as a general acid. The loop that folds over the NAD(P)H cosubstrate is disordered in the apo form but becomes ordered upon cosubstrate binding. A slow conformational isomerization of this loop probably accounts for the observed rate-limiting step involving release of cosubstrate. Xylose binding (K(m) = 87 mM) is mediated by interactions with a binding pocket that is more polar than a typical aldo-keto reductase. Modeling of xylose into the active site of the holoenzyme using ordered waters as a guide for sugar hydroxyls suggests a convincing mode of substrate binding.},

  abstract = {Filtration techniques in the form of rapid elimination of candidate sequences while retaining the true one are key ingredients of database searches in genomics. Although SEQUEST and Mascot perform a conceptually similar task to the tool BLAST, the key algorithmic idea of BLAST (filtration) was never implemented in these tools. As a result MS/MS protein identification tools are becoming too time-consuming for many applications including search for post-translationally modified peptides. Moreover, matching millions of spectra against all known proteins will soon make these tools too slow in the same way that "genome vs genome" comparisons instantly made BLAST too slow. We describe the development of filters for MS/MS database searches that dramatically reduce the running time and effectively remove the bottlenecks in searching the huge space of protein modifications. Our approach, based on a probability model for determining the accuracy of sequence tags, achieves superior results compared to GutenTag, a popular tag generation algorithm. Our tag generating algorithm along with our de novo sequencing algorithm PepNovo can be accessed via the URL http://peptide.ucsd.edu/.},

  volume = {7},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0041903},
  abstract = {Background: Dermatophyte fungi of the family Arthrodermataceae (Eurotiomycetes) colonize keratinized tissue, such as skin, frequently causing superficial mycoses in humans and other mammals, reptiles, and birds. Competition with native microflora likely underlies the propensity of these dermatophytes to produce a diversity of antibiotics and compounds for scavenging iron, which is extremely scarce, as well as the presence of an unusually large number of putative secondary metabolism gene clusters, most of which contain non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), in their genomes. To better understand the historical origins and diversification of NRPS-containing gene clusters we examined the evolution of a variable locus (VL) that exists in one of three alternative conformations among the genomes of seven dermatophyte species. Results: The first conformation of the VL (termed VLA) contains only 539 base pairs of sequence and lacks protein-coding genes, whereas the other two conformations (termed VLB and VLC) span 36 Kb and 27 Kb and contain 12 and 10 genes, respectively. Interestingly, both VLB and VLC appear to contain distinct secondary metabolism gene clusters; VLB contains a NRPS gene as well as four porphyrin metabolism genes never found to be physically linked in the genomes of 128 other fungal species, whereas VLC also contains a NRPS gene as well as several others typically found associated with secondary metabolism gene clusters. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that the VL locus was present in the ancestor of all seven species achieving its present distribution through subsequent differential losses or retentions of specific conformations. Conclusions: We propose that the existence of variable loci, similar to the one we studied, in fungal genomes could potentially explain the dramatic differences in secondary metabolic diversity between closely related species of filamentous fungi, and contribute to host adaptation and the generation of metabolic diversity.},

Although significant advances have been made in understanding how fungi cause disease, the dynamic microenvironments encountered by fungi during infection and the mechanisms by which they adapt to these microenvironments are not fully understood. As inhibiting and preventing in vivo fungal growth are main goals of antifungal therapies, understanding in vivo fungal metabolism in these host microenvironments is critical for the improvement of existing therapies or the design of new approaches. In this minireview, we focus on the emerging appreciation that pathogenic fungi like Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus are exposed to oxygen-limited or hypoxic microenvironments during fungal pathogenesis. The implications of these in vivo hypoxic microenvironments for fungal metabolism and pathogenesis are discussed with an aim toward understanding the potential impact of hypoxia on invasive fungal infection outcomes.},

Thanks to their dual hydroxylic and peroxidative cycles, they can produce ROS as well as oxidize cell wall aromatic compounds within proteins and phenolics that are either free or linked to polysaccharides. Thus, they are tightly associated to cell wall loosening and stiffening. They are members of large multigenic families, mostly due to an elevated rate of gene duplication in higher plants, resulting in a high risk of functional redundancy between them. However, proteomic and (micro)transcriptomic analyses have shown that CIII Prx expression profiles are highly specific. Based on these omic analyses, several reverse genetic studies have demonstrated the importance of the spatio-temporal regulation of their expression and ability to interact with cell wall microdomains in order to achieve specific activity in vivo. Each CIII Prx isoform could have specific functions in muro and this could explain the conservation of a high number of genes in plant genomes.},

The PRIDE Converter 2 tool suite allows users to convert search result files into PRIDE XML (the format needed for performing submissions to the PRIDE database), generate mzTab skeleton files that can be used as a basis to submit quantitative and gel-based MS data, and post-process PRIDE XML files by filtering out contaminants and empty spectra, or by merging several PRIDE XML files together. All the tools have both a graphical user interface that provides a dialog-based, user-friendly way to convert and prepare files for submission, as well as a command-line interface that can be used to integrate the tools into existing or novel pipelines, for batch processing and power users. The PRIDE Converter 2 tool suite will thus become a cornerstone in the submission process to PRIDE and, by extension, to the ProteomeXchange consortium of MS-proteomics data repositories.},

Our results showed that the pigment produced by MEL1 and MEL2 mutants possesses physical and chemical properties and UV- and IR-spectra very similar to synthetic DOPA-melanin. The characterization of this pigment in terms of its degradation products indicated the presence of indolic units, which were also found in synthetic DOPA-melanin. The analyses of the elemental composition showed that the pigment extracted from these mutants has a high percentage of nitrogen and, therefore, it cannot be DHN-melanin, which presents only trace of nitrogen. This observation was confirmed in the test with tricyclazole because this inhibitor of DHN-melanin biosynthesis did not suppress pigment production in the MEL1 and MEL2 strains. On the other hand, in a medium containing tropolone, an inhibitor of DOPA-melanin biosynthesis, the dark pigmentation of the colonies was not observed indicating that this compound inhibited melanin production in these strains. Taken together, the results obtained in this study indicate that melanin produced by these mutants is DOPA type, representing the first report on characterization of this type of melanin in A. nidulans.},

MS-based proteomics and protein arrays are the main players in large-scale proteome analysis and an integration of these two methodologies is powerful but presently not sufficient for detailed quantitative and spatiotemporal proteome characterization. Improvements of instrumentation for MS-based proteomics have been achieved recently resulting in data sets of approximately one million spectra which is a large step in the right direction. The corresponding raw data range from 50 to 100\,Gb and are frequently made available. Multidimensional LC-MS data sets have been demonstrated to identify and quantitate 2000-8000 proteins from whole cell extracts. The analysis of the resulting data sets requires several steps from raw data processing, to database-dependent search, statistical evaluation of the search result, quantitative algorithms and statistical analysis of quantitative data. A large number of software tools have been proposed for the above-mentioned tasks. However, it is not the aim of this review to cover all software tools, but rather discuss common data analysis strategies used by various algorithms for each of the above-mentioned steps in a non-redundant approach and to argue that there are still some areas which need improvements.},

Employing the expectation maximization algorithm, the analysis learns to distinguish correct from incorrect database search results, computing probabilities that peptide assignments to spectra are correct based upon database search scores and the number of tryptic termini of peptides. Using SEQUEST search results for spectra generated from a sample of known protein components, we demonstrate that the computed probabilities are accurate and have high power to discriminate between correctly and incorrectly assigned peptides. This analysis makes it possible to filter large volumes of MS/MS database search results with predictable false identification error rates and can serve as a common standard by which the results of different research groups are compared.},

Depending on the nature of the ROS species, some are highly toxic and rapidly detoxified by various cellular enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms. Whereas plants are surfeited with mechanisms to combat increased ROS levels during abiotic stress conditions, in other circumstances plants appear to purposefully generate ROS as signaling molecules to control various processes including pathogen defense, programmed cell death, and stomatal behavior. This review describes the mechanisms of ROS generation and removal in plants during development and under biotic and abiotic stress conditions. New insights into the complexity and roles that ROS play in plants have come from genetic analyses of ROS detoxifying and signaling mutants. Considering recent ROS-induced genome-wide expression analyses, the possible functions and mechanisms for ROS sensing and signaling in plants are compared with those in animals and yeast.},

This approach was tested in a small-scale proteomic project involving the identification of 15 bands of gel-separated proteins from the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, whose genome has not yet been sequenced and which is only distantly related to other fungi.},

Little, however, is known about the signal transduction for inducing expression of the pox genes. Recent studies have provided information on the regulatory mechanisms of wound- and pathogen-induced expression of some pox genes.

AIM: To test the decontamination power of two cold plasma sources [low-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) and dielectric barrier discharge plasma (DBD)] in vivo on human fingertips.
METHODS: After 3, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 s of spot treatment with the APPJ and DBD, the log reduction factors (RFs) of physiological (PF) and artificially (AF) contaminated flora (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus) were calculated. The bacterial load was determined after counting. Tolerance (paresthesia, pain and heat) was measured using a numerical rating scale.
FINDINGS: Both plasma devices led to a significant reduction in PF and AF. The maximum log reduction factors for PF were 1.3 for the DBD at 210 s and 0.8 for the APPJ at 60 s. For AF, the maximum log reduction factors were 1.7 for the DBD at 90 s and 1.4 for the APPJ at 120 s. Treatment with both devices was well tolerated.
CONCLUSION: Both the APPJ and DBD were highly effective in eradicating PF and AF from the fingertips of healthy volunteers. No plasma-resistant isolates were observed. Cold plasma appears to have potential for skin disinfection. For hand hygiene purposes, plasma exposure times would need to be reduced significantly by technical means.},

The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is an emerging pathogen of amphibians that has been implicated in amphibian declines worldwide. Bd is the only member of its clade known to attack vertebrates. However, little is known about the molecular determinants of - or evolutionary transition to -pathogenicity in Bd. Here we sequence the genome of Bd's closest known relative - a non-pathogenic chytrid Homolaphlyctis polyrhiza (Hp). We first describe the genome of Hp, which is comparable to other chytrid genomes in size and number of predicted proteins. We then compare the genomes of Hp, Bd, and 19 additional fungal genomes to identify unique or recent evolutionary elements in the Bd genome. We identified 1,974 Bd-specific genes, a gene set that is enriched for protease, lipase, and microbial effector Gene Ontology terms. We describe significant lineage-specific expansions in three Bd protease families (metallo-, serine-type, and aspartyl proteases). We show that these protease gene family expansions occurred after the divergence of Bd and Hp from their common ancestor and thus are localized to the Bd branch. Finally, we demonstrate that the timing of the protease gene family expansions predates the emergence of Bd as a globally important amphibian pathogen.},

  abstract = {About 40 coffee aroma constituents belonging to the classes of dicarbonyls, sulphur-containing compounds, furfuryls, N-heterocyclics and others were systematically evaluated in three Ames tester strains. Only aliphatic dicarbonyl compounds showed notable direct mutagenic activity, which mainly affected 'base-pair substitution' in Ames tester strains TA100 and TA102. Very weak effects were also seen with some N-heterocyclics, mainly affecting frameshift tester strain TA98 upon metabolic activation. However, it was shown that these N-heterocyclics do not contribute substantially to the mutagenicity in coffee. The hydrogen peroxide and methylglyoxal contents of coffee were determined up to 26 hr after preparation. Their concentrations tended to decrease whereas mutagenic activity decreased significantly with time in tester strains TA100 and TA102. It is concluded that several highly labile coffee constituents contribute to the bacterial mutagenicity and also that the synergism between hydrogen peroxide and methylglyoxal is not the main factor. The absence of coffee mutagenicity/carcinogenicity in rodents with these highly reactive coffee aroma compounds can be explained in part by detoxification of microsomal enzyme systems.},

  abstract = {Pyrrolnitrin is a bacterial metabolite, served as a natural lead of agricultural fungicides. In a previous study, fenpiclonil was proven to inhibit the oxidative transformation of aminopyrrolnitrin to pyrrolnitrin, catalyzed by aminopyrrolnitrin oxidase (PrnD). This monooxygenase has an interesting catalytic activity of selective oxidation of aromatic amines, rather than aliphatic amines. However, its structural details are not well understood. In this study, various analogues of pyrrolnitrin were prepared to elucidate the structures of active site of PrnD through structure-activity relationships. In vivo pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis inhibition was determined with Burkholderia sp. O33 and Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5. Quantitative analysis of pyrrolnitrin and precursors indicates that 2,3-disubstituted phenyl at 3rd carbon and small substituents at 4th carbon of pyrrole are strictly required to give strong inhibitory effects. In addition, dissociable proton of pyrrole is also critical for inhibitory activity. Molecular simulation with homology-based PrnD model suggests a highly restricted conformational space in active site. The results may help more detailed understanding of this unusual enzyme. In addition, the information will be useful for the development of novel fungicide, compatible with pyrrolnitrin-producing bacterium.},

In this paper, a reliable and user-friendly plasma-jet device, which can generate plasma inside the root canal, is reported. The plasma can be touched by bare hands and can be directed manually by a user to place it into root canal for disinfection without causing any painful sensation. When He/O2(20\%) is used as working gas, the rotational and vibrational temperatures of the plasma are about 300 K and 2700 K, respectively. The peak discharge current is about 10 mA. Preliminary inactivation experiment results show that it can efficiently kill enterococcus faecalis , one of the main types of bacterium causing failure of root-canal treatment in several minutes.},

The antimicrobial and antitumor activities of aureothin have caught our interest in modulating its structure as well as its bioactivity profile. In an integrated approach using mutasynthesis, biotransformation, and combinatorial biosynthesis, a defined library of aureothin analogues was generated. The promiscuity of the polyketide synthase assembly line toward different starter units and the plasticity of the pyrone and tetrahydrofuran ring formation were exploited. A selection of 15 new aureothin analogues with modifications at the aryl residue, the pyrone ring, and the oxygenated backbone was produced on a preparative scale and fully characterized. Remarkably, various new aureothin derivatives are less cytotoxic than aureothin but have improved antiproliferative activities. Furthermore, we found that the THF ring is crucial for the remarkably selective activity of aureothin analogues against certain pathogenic fungi.},

In this paper, we report on computational studies of the intersection of plasma streamers in atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) sustained in air with human skin tissue, with emphasis on the intracellular generation of electric fields. Intracellular structures and their electrical properties were incorporated into the computational mesh in order to self-consistently couple gas phase plasma transport with the charging of the surface of the skin and the intracellular production of electrical currents. The short duration of a single plasma filament in DBDs and its intersection with skin enables the intracellular penetration of electric fields. The magnitude of these electric fields can reach 100 kV cm-1 which may exceed the threshold for electroporation.},

Increased awareness amongst researchers and continued support from major MS vendors in providing tools for converting proprietary formats into imzML are likely to result in a rapidly increasing uptake of the format. It is important that this does not lead to the exclusion of researchers using older or unsupported instruments. We describe an open source converter, imzMLConverter, to ensure against this. We propose that proprietary formats should first be converted to mzML using one of the widely available converters, such as msconvert and then use imzMLConverter to convert mzML to imzML. This will allow a wider audience to benefit from the imzML format immediately.},

  abstract = {Although several investigations have demonstrated a plasma membrane (PM)-bound peroxidase activity in plants, this study is the first, to our knowledge, to purify and characterize the enzymes responsible. Proteins were extracted from highly enriched and thoroughly washed PMs. Washing and solubilization procedures indicated that the enzymes were tightly bound to the membrane. At least two distinct peroxidase activities could be separated by cation exchange chromatography (pmPOX1 and pmPOX2). Prosthetic groups were identified in fractions with peroxidase activity by absorption spectra, and the corresponding protein bands were identified by heme staining. The activities of the peroxidase enzymes responded different to various substrates and effectors and had different thermal stabilities and pH and temperature optima. Because the enzymes were localized at the PM and were not effected by p-chloromercuribenzoate, they were probably class III peroxidases. Additional size exclusion chromatography of pmPOX1 revealed a single activity peak with a molecular mass of 70 kD for the native enzyme, whereas pmPOX2 had two activity peaks (155 and 40 kD). Further analysis of these fractions by a modified sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with heme staining confirmed the estimated molecular masses of the size exclusion chromatography.},

The development of MDR in yeast is frequently associated with gain-of-function mutations in the Zn(2)Cys(6) transcription factors activating the expression of several plasma membrane exporters. In the aerobic yeast Kluyveromyces lactis the Zn(2)Cys(6) transcription factor KlPdr1p is involved in the control of multidrug resistance. The aim of the present study was to identify the changes in K. lactis proteome of the Klpdr1 Delta deletion mutant compared with the wild-type expressing the KlPDR1 gene from a multicopy plasmid. A total of 15 differentially expressed proteins, out of 20 spots with different intensities detected, were identified. In the Klpdr1 Delta deletion mutant, the increase in the abundance of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism (mainly glycolysis/gluconeogenesis) was observed. Most of the proteins overexpressed in the wild type strain containing the KlPDR1 gene on multicopy plasmid were involved in the stress defence and redox homeostasis. The results indicate a close connection between MDR and oxidative stress response associated with the post-translational mechanisms regulating the levels of active forms of proteins involved in K. lactis MDR.

The chemical potential of the heterodinuclear metal site is just starting to be characterized, but available data suggest that it may have capabilities for similarly versatile chemistry as the extensively studied diiron-carboxylate cofactor. The presently identified members of the manganese/iron-carboxylate proteins are all sequence homologues of the radical-generating R2 subunit of class I ribonucleotide reductase, canonically a diiron protein. They are also commonly misannotated as such in databases. In spite of the sequence similarity, the manganese/iron-carboxylate proteins form at least two functionally distinct groups, radical-generating ribonucleotide reductase subunits and ligand-binding Mn/Fe proteins. Here, the presently available sequences for the manganese/iron-carboxylate proteins are gathered, grouped, and analyzed. The analysis provides sequence determinants that allow group identification of new sequences on the single-protein level. Key differences between the groups are mapped on the known representative structures, providing clues to the structural prerequisites for metal specificity, cofactor formation, and difference in function. The organisms that encode manganese/iron-carboxylate proteins are briefly discussed; their environmental preference suggests that the Mn/Fe heterodinuclear cofactor is preferred by extremophiles and pathogens with a particularly high relative presence in Archaea.},

Here, we describe the rational programming of function in a de novo designed di-iron carboxylate protein from the Due Ferri family. Originally created to catalyse the O-2-dependent, two-electron oxidation of hydroquinones, the protein was reprogrammed to catalyse the selective N-hydroxylation of arylamines by remodelling the substrate access cavity and introducing a critical third His ligand to the metal-binding cavity. Additional second-and third-shell modifications were required to stabilize the His ligand in the core of the protein. These structural changes resulted in at least a 10(6)-fold increase in the relative rate between the arylamine N-hydroxylation and hydroquinone oxidation reactions. This result highlights the potential for using de novo proteins as scaffolds for future investigations of the geometric and electronic factors that influence the catalytic tuning of di-iron active sites.},

To shed light on the genetic equipment of this model organism, we sequenced the whole genome of B. rhizoxinica HKI 0454, thus providing the first genomic insight into an intracellular mutualist of a fungal species. The 3.75-Mb genome consists of a chromosome and two strain-specific plasmids. The primary metabolism appears to be specialized for the uptake of fungal metabolites. Besides the rhizoxin biosynthesis gene cluster, there are 14 loci coding for nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines, which represent novel targets for genomic mining of cryptic natural products. Furthermore, the endosymbionts are equipped with a repertoire of virulence-related factors, which can now be studied to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial-fungal interaction.},

Recently we characterized a novel arylamine N-oxygenase (PrnD), a new member of the two-component oxygenase family (J. Lee et al., J. Biol. Chem. 280:36719-36728, 2005). Although arylamine N-oxygenases are widespread in nature, aminopyrrolnitrin N-oxygenase (PrnD) represents the only biochemically and mechanistically characterized arylamine N-oxygenase to date. Here we report the use of bioinformatic and biochemical tools to identify and characterize the reductase component (PrnF) involved in the PrnD-catalyzed unusual arylamine oxidation. The prnF gene was identified via sequence analysis of the whole genome of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 and subsequently cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purified PrnF protein catalyzes reduction of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) by NADH with a k(cat) of 65 s(-1) (K-m = 3.2 mu M for FAD and 43.1 mu M for NADH) and supplies reduced FAD to the PrnD oxygenase component. Unlike other known reductases in two-component oxygenase systems, PrnF strictly requires NADH as an electron donor to reduce FAD and requires unusual protein-protein interaction with the PrnD component for the efficient transfer of reduced FAD. This PrnF enzyme represents the first cloned and characterized flavin reductase component in a novel two-component arylamine oxygenase system.},

In instances where host debilitation occurs, Candida can cause a range of clinical infections, and whilst these are primarily superficial, effecting mucosal membranes, systemic infections can develop in severely immunocompromised individuals. The mechanism of host immunity during commensal carriage of C. albicans has been intensively studied. In this paper, we present the most recent information concerning host recognition of C. albicans leading to cytokine production and the subsequent T-cell responses generated in response to C. albicans. Particular focus is given to the role of the IL-12 cytokine family including IL-12, IL-23, IL-27, and IL-35, in host immunity to Candida. CD4(+) T-cells are considered crucial in the regulation of immunity and inflammation. In this regard, the role of Th1/2, helper cells, together with the recently identified Th17 and Treg cells in candidosis will be discussed. Understanding the detailed mechanisms that underlie host immunity to Candida not only will be of benefit in terms of the infections caused by this organism but could also be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions for other diseases.},

  abstract = {Background: Regional lymph node (LN) status is a well-known prognostic factor for vulvar carcinoma (VC) patients. Although the reliable LN assessment in VC is crucial, it presents significant diagnostic problems. We aimed to identify specific mRNA markers of VC dissemination in the LN and to address the feasibility of predicting the risk of nodal recurrence by the patterns of gene expression. Methods: Sentinel and inguinal LN samples from 20 patients who had undergone surgery for stage T1-3, N0-2, M-0 primary vulvar squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed. Gene expression profiles were assessed in four metastatic [LN(+)] and four histologically negative [LN(-)] lymph node samples obtained from four VC patients, by the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 gene expression microarrays. Of the set of genes of the highest expression in the metastatic LNs compared to LN(-), seven candidate marker genes were selected: PERP, S100A8, FABP5, SFN, CA12, JUP and CSTA, and the expression levels of these genes were further analyzed by the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in 71 LN samples. Results: All of the seven genes in question were significantly increased in LN(+) compared to LN(-) samples. In the initial validation of the seven putative markers of metastatic LN, the Cox proportional hazard model pointed to SFN, CA12 and JUP expression to significantly relate to the time to groin recurrence in VC patients. Conclusions: Our findings first provided evidence that SFN, CA12 and JUP have a potential of marker genes for the prediction of the groin recurrence LN in VC patients.},

Penicillin biosynthesis is an excellent model system for many other bioactive microbial metabolites. The recent publication of the P. chrysogenum genome has established the basis to understand the molecular processes underlying penicillin overproduction. We report here the proteome reference map of P. chrysogenum Wisconsin 54-1255 (the genome project reference strain) together with an in-depth study of the changes produced in three different strains of this filamentous fungus during industrial strain improvement. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, peptide mass fingerprinting, and tandem mass spectrometry were used for protein identification. Around 1000 spots were visualized by ``blue silver'' colloidal Coomassie staining in a non-linear pI range from 3 to 10 with high resolution, which allowed the identification of 950 proteins (549 different proteins and isoforms). Comparison among the cytosolic proteomes of the wild-type NRRL 1951, Wisconsin 541255 (an improved, moderate penicillin producer), and AS-P-78 (a penicillin high producer) strains indicated that global metabolic reorganizations occurred during the strain improvement program. The main changes observed in the high producer strains were increases of cysteine biosynthesis (a penicillin precursor), enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway, and stress response proteins together with a reduction in virulence and in the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites different from penicillin (pigments and isoflavonoids). In the wild-type strain, we identified enzymes to utilize cellulose, sorbitol, and other carbon sources that have been lost in the high penicillin producer strains. Changes in the levels of a few specific proteins correlated well with the improved penicillin biosynthesis in the high producer strains. These results provide useful information to improve the production of many other bioactive secondary metabolites. Molecular \& Cellular Proteomics 9:1182-1198, 2010.},

Following retention time correction, the relative metabolite ion intensities are directly compared to identify changes in specific endogenous metabolites, such as potential biomarkers.

  volume = {2},
  abstract = {Proper disposal of seafood wastes is a continuous problem along the Eastern shores of the United States. Blue crab and scallop processing plants continuously dumped their residues into landfills, creating management and environmental concerns associated with ground and drinking water pollution. Additionally, build up of seafood waste generates an unpleasant odour and becomes an eye-sore to both tourists and local communities. Consequently, the present study was designed to evaluate alternate uses for seafood wastes that are economically feasible. The goal of this study was to isolate chitosan from crab exoskeletons and evaluate its potential as a fungicide against seed infection and a plant growth enhancer. Chitosan was obtained by first removing the shell-meat and recovering the calcium carbonate and proteins. Crab exoskeleton samples were demineralized with either 0.5\% or 1.0\% HCl or 5\% or 10\% CH3COOH. A growth enhancement study was conducted with black-eyed peas exposed to the different chitosan treatments. A similar anti-fungal experiment with peanut seeds infested with Penicillium was conducted as well. Data on plants height, stem diameter and leaf counts were recorded biweekly for 4 months and analysed using PROC ANOVA And PROC General Linear Model Statistical Systems. These measurements suggested that seeds pre-treated with the chitosan extracted with 0.5\% HCl had the best overall growth and both chitosan (0.5\% HCl) and Captan were the most effective in eliminating fungus from groundnuts. This research presents plausible possibilities in which seafood waste can be utilized for agricultural purposes.},

However, their use has been limited by their relatively slow killing speed compared to chemicals and low tolerance to abiotic stresses. We report here on a class 1 laccase (MLAC1) that is involved in both virulence and tolerance to environmental stresses. Mlac1 is expressed during isotropic growth (swelling) but not during polarized growth (e.g., germ tubes and hyphae); Mlac1 is therefore expressed exclusively in the later stages of conidiation and in blastospores when M. anisopliae is living as a saprophyte. During infection processes, Mlac1 is also expressed by appressoria (infection structures) on the cuticle surface and hyphal bodies inside the insect haemocoel. Disrupting Mlac1 reduced virulence to caterpillars because of impaired appressoria and delayed post-infection events. It also produced a yellow-conidia phenotype with increased conidial susceptibility to heat shock (45 degrees C for 2 h) and UV-B stress. The relationship between M. anisopliae's pigment-synthesis pathway and its adaptation to diverse natural habitats is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities.

The unique ability to identify and spatially resolve numerous compounds simultaneously, based on m/z values has inter alia been applied to untargeted and targeted chemical mapping of biological compartments, revealing changes of physiological states, disease pathologies and metabolic faith and distribution of xenobiotics. Many MSI applications focus on lipid species because of the lipids' diverse roles as structural components of cell membranes, their function in the surfactant cycle, and their involvement as second messengers in signalling cascades of tissues and cells. This article gives a comprehensive overview of lipid imaging techniques and applications using established MALDI and SIMS methods but also other promising MSI techniques such as DESI.},

In the human fungal pathogen C. albicans Msb2 signals via the Cek1 MAP kinase pathway to maintain cell wall integrity and allow filamentous growth. Msb2 doubly epitope-tagged in its large extracellular and small cytoplasmic domain was efficiently cleaved during liquid and surface growth and the extracellular domain was almost quantitatively released into the growth medium. Msb2 cleavage was independent of proteases Sap9, Sap10 and Kex2. Secreted Msb2 was highly O-glycosylated by protein mannosyltransferases including Pmt1 resulting in an apparent molecular mass of $>$400 kDa. Deletion analyses revealed that the transmembrane region is required for Msb2 function, while the large N-terminal and the small cytoplasmic region function to downregulate Msb2 signaling or, respectively, allow its induction by tunicamycin. Purified extracellular Msb2 domain protected fungal and bacterial cells effectively from antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) histatin-5 and LL-37. AMP inactivation was not due to degradation but depended on the quantity and length of the Msb2 glycofragment. C. albicans msb2 mutants were supersensitive to LL-37 but not histatin-5, suggesting that secreted rather than cell-associated Msb2 determines AMP protection. Thus, in addition to its sensor function Msb2 has a second activity because shedding of its glycofragment generates AMP quorum resistance.},

  abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus, the most common airborne fungal pathogen of humans, employs two high-affinity iron uptake systems: iron uptake mediated by the extracellular siderophore triacetylfusarinine C and reductive iron assimilation. Furthermore, A. fumigatus utilizes two intracellular siderophores, ferricrocin and hydroxyferricrocin, to store iron. Siderophore biosynthesis, which is essential for virulence, is repressed by iron. Here we show that this control is mediated by the GATA factor SreA. During iron-replete conditions, SreA deficiency partially derepressed synthesis of triacetylfusarinine C and uptake of iron resulting in increased cellular accumulation of both iron and ferricrocin. Genome-wide DNA microarray analysis identified 49 genes that are repressed by iron in an SreA-dependent manner. This gene set, termed SreA regulon, includes all known genes involved in iron acquisition, putative novel siderophore biosynthetic genes, and also genes not directly linked to iron metabolism. SreA deficiency also caused upregulation of iron-dependent and antioxidative pathways, probably due to the increased iron content and iron-mediated oxidative stress. Consistently, the sreA disruption mutant displayed increased sensitivity to iron, menadion and phleomycin but retained wild-type virulence in a mouse model. As all detrimental effects of sreA disruption are restricted to iron-replete conditions these data underscore that A. fumigatus faces iron-depleted conditions during infection.},

This species has been reported to produce a large number of extrolites, including secondary metabolites, acids, and proteins such as hydrophobins and extracellular enzymes. At least 226 potentially bioactive secondary metabolites have been reported from A. fumigatus that can be ordered into 24 biosynthetic families. Of these families we have detected representatives from the following families of secondary metabolites: fumigatins, fumigaclavines, fumiquinazolines, trypacidin and monomethylsulochrin, fumagillins, gliotoxins, pseurotins, chloroanthraquinones, fumitremorgins, verruculogen, helvolic acids, and pyripyropenes by HPLC with diode array detection and mass spectrometric detection. There is still doubt whether A. fumigatus can produce tryptoquivalins, but all isolates produce the related fumiquinazolines. We also tentatively detected sphingofungins in A. fumigatus Af293 and in an isolate of A. lentulus. The sphingofungins may have a similar role as the toxic fumonisins, found in A. niger. A further number of mycotoxins, including ochratoxin A, and other secondary metabolites have been reported from A. fumigatus, but in those cases either the fungus or its metabolite appear to be misidentified.},

  abstract = {Surface-associated and secreted proteins represent primarily exposed components of Aspergillus fumigatus during host infection. Several secreted proteins are known to be involved in defense mechanisms or immune evasion, thus, probably contributing to pathogenicity. Furthermore, several secreted antigens were identified as possible biomarkers for the verification of diseases caused by Aspergillus species. Nevertheless, there is only limited knowledge about the composition of the secretome and about molecular functions of particular proteins. To identify secreted proteins potentially essential for virulence, the core secretome of A. fumigatus grown in minimal medium was determined. Two-dimensional gel electrophoretic separation and subsequent MALDI-TOF-MS/MS analyses resulted in the identification of 64 different proteins. Additionally, secretome analyses of A. fumigatus utilizing elastin, collagen or keratin as main carbon and nitrogen source were performed. Thereby, the alkaline serine protease Alp1 was identified as the most abundant protein and hence presumably represents an important protease during host infection. Interestingly, the Asp-hemolysin (Asp-HS), which belongs to the protein family of aegerolysins and which was often suggested to be involved in fungal virulence, was present in the secretome under all growth conditions tested. In addition, a second, non-secreted protein with an aegerolysin domain annotated as Asp-hemolysin-like (HS-like) protein can be found to be encoded in the genome of A. fumigatus. Generation and analysis of Asp-HS and HS-like deletion strains revealed no differences in phenotype compared to the corresponding wild-type strain. Furthermore, hemolysis and cytotoxicity was not altered in both single-deletion and double-deletion mutants lacking both aegerolysin genes. All mutant strains showed no attenuation in virulence in a mouse infection model for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of secreted proteins of A. fumigatus and a detailed characterization of hemolysin mutants. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

The global coffee chain has changed dramatically as a result of deregulation, new consumption patterns, and evolving corporate strategies. From a balanced contest between producing and consuming countries within the politics of international coffee agreements, power relations shifted to the advantage of transnational corporations. A relatively stable institutional environment where proportions of generated income were fairly distributed between producing and consuming countries turned into one that is more informal, unstable, and unequal. Through the lenses of global commodity chain analysis, this paper examines how these transformations affect developing countries and what policy instruments are available to address the emerging imbalances.},

Improvement of therapeutically outcomes depends on more precise and earlier diagnostics, and biomarkers discovery and validation are considered the key for this, and also an essential tool in drug discovery. Omics technologies are intensely involved in biomarkers research. SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry combines flexibility, resolving power and sensitivity with high throughput potential, generating a suitable proteomic platform for research and clinical applications. SELDI platforms have been used to identify, protein biomarkers in a variety of cancers, resulting in promising diagnostic strategies. Outcomes of SELDI technology in protein profiling of different samples prove its resources and reliability in biomarkers discovery, and recommend it as a major clinical tool of the future. Significant results obtained in pancreatic, colon, cervical, breast and brain tumors have been described. Relevant proteomic signatures could be identified in different sample types, setting up potential diagnostics and/or prognostics instruments for various cancers. Success in validation has already been achieved in some cases, yet the overall conclusion is that SELDI technology represents one component of a broader spectrum of versatile investigation technologies that may finally lead to setting up a more ``clinical friendly'' set of dedicated diagnostics tools.},

We applied SMURF to catalog putative clusters in 27 publicly available fungal genomes. Comparison with genetically characterized clusters from six fungal species showed that SMURF accurately recovered all clusters and detected additional potential clusters. Subsequent comparative analysis revealed the striking biosynthetic capacity and variability of the fungal SM pathways and the correlation between unicellularity and the absence of SMs. Further genetics studies are needed to experimentally confirm these clusters.

  abstract = {The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is a protein folding machine that is conserved from bacteria to man. Human, cytosolic Hsp90 is dedicated to folding of chiefly signal transduction components. The chaperoning mechanism of Hsp90 is controlled by ATP and various cochaperones, but is poorly understood and controversial. Here, we characterized the Apo and ATP states of the 170-kDa human Hsp90 full-length protein by NMR spectroscopy in solution, and we elucidated the mechanism of the inhibition of its ATPase by its cochaperone p23. We assigned isoleucine side chains of Hsp90 via specific isotope labeling of their delta-methyl groups, which allowed the NMR analysis of the full-length protein. We found that ATP caused exclusively local changes in Hsp90' s N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain. Native mass spectrometry showed that Hsp90 and p23 form a 2:2 complex via a positively cooperative mechanism. Despite this stoichiometry, NMR data indicated that the complex was not fully symmetric. The p23-dependent NMR shifts mapped to both the lid and the adenine end of Hsp90's ATP binding pocket, but also to large parts of the middle domain. Shifts distant from the p23 binding site reflect p23-induced conformational changes in Hsp90. Together, we conclude that it is Hsp90' s nucleotide-binding domain that triggers the formation of the Hsp90(2)p23(2) complex. We anticipate that our NMR approach has significant impact on future studies of full-length Hsp90 with cofactors and substrates, but also for the development of Hsp90 inhibiting anticancer drugs.},

  doi = {10.1186/1477-5956-10-30},
  abstract = {Background: The pathogenic mold Aspergillus fumigatus is the most frequent infectious cause of death in severely immunocompromised individuals such as leukemia and bone marrow transplant patients. Germination of inhaled conidia (asexual spores) in the host is critical for the initiation of infection, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms of this process. Results: To gain insights into early germination events and facilitate the identification of potential stage-specific biomarkers and vaccine candidates, we have used quantitative shotgun proteomics to elucidate patterns of protein abundance changes during early fungal development. Four different stages were examined: dormant conidia, isotropically expanding conidia, hyphae in which germ tube emergence has just begun, and pre-septation hyphae. To enrich for glycan-linked cell wall proteins we used an alkaline cell extraction method. Shotgun proteomic resulted in the identification of 375 unique gene products with high confidence, with no evidence for enrichment of cell wall-immobilized and secreted proteins. The most interesting discovery was the identification of 52 proteins enriched in dormant conidia including 28 proteins that have never been detected in the A. fumigatus conidial proteome such as signaling protein Pil1, chaperones BipA and calnexin, and transcription factor HapB. Additionally we found many small, Aspergillus specific proteins of unknown function including 17 hypothetical proteins. Thus, the most abundant protein, Grg1 (AFUA\_5G14210), was also one of the smallest proteins detected in this study (M. W. 7,367). Among previously characterized proteins were melanin pigment and pseurotin A biosynthesis enzymes, histones H3 and H4.1, and other proteins involved in conidiation and response to oxidative or hypoxic stress. In contrast, expanding conidia, hyphae with early germ tubes, and pre-septation hyphae samples were enriched for proteins responsible for housekeeping functions, particularly translation, respiratory metabolism, amino acid and carbohydrate biosynthesis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Conclusions: The observed temporal expression patterns suggest that the A. fumigatus conidia are dominated by small, lineage-specific proteins. Some of them may play key roles in host-pathogen interactions, signal transduction during conidial germination, or survival in hostile environments.},

  abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides are promising antibiotics as they possess strong antimicrobial activity and very broad spectra of activity. However, administration of an antibiotic with a very broad spectrum of activity disrupts normal microflora and increases the risks of other fatal infections. To solve the problem, we designed a novel antimicrobial peptide that is activated by virulent proteases of pathogenic organisms. We constructed a peptide composed of three domains, namely an antimicrobial peptide (lactoferricin) as the active center, a protective peptide (magainin intervening sequence) that suppresses antimicrobial activity, and a specific linker that joins these two components and is efficiently cleaved by virulent proteases. We utilized Candida albicans as a model organism that produces secreted aspartic proteases as a virulence attribute. We screened for a peptide sequence efficiently cleaved by secreted aspartic proteases isozymes and identified a GFIKAFPK peptide as the most favorable substrate. Subsequently, we chemically synthesized a peptide containing the GFIKAFPK sequence. The designed peptide possessed no antimicrobial activity until it was activated by secreted aspartic proteases isozymes. Furthermore, it demonstrated selective antimicrobial activity against C.similar to albicans, but not against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A designed peptide like the one described in this study may protect normal microflora, resulting in enhanced safety as a therapeutic.},

  abstract = {Filamentous fungi are widely known for their industrial applications, namely, the production of food-processing enzymes and metabolites such as antibiotics and organic acids. In the past decade, the full genome sequencing of filamentous fungi increased the potential to predict encoded proteins enormously, namely, hydrolytic enzymes or proteins involved in the biosynthesis of metabolites of interest. The integration of genome sequence information with possible phenotypes requires, however, the knowledge of all the proteins in the cell in a system-wise manner, given by proteomics. This review summarises the progress of proteomics and its importance for the study of biotechnological processes in filamentous fungi. A major step forward in proteomics was to couple protein separation with high-resolution mass spectrometry, allowing accurate protein quantification. Despite the fact that most fungal proteomic studies have been focused on proteins from mycelial extracts, many proteins are related to processes which are compartmentalised in the fungal cell, e.g. beta-lactam antibiotic production in the microbody. For the study of such processes, a targeted approach is required, e.g. by organelle proteomics. Typical workflows for sample preparation in fungal organelle proteomics are discussed, including homogenisation and sub-cellular fractionation. Finally, examples are presented of fungal organelle proteomic studies, which have enlarged the knowledge on areas of interest to biotechnology, such as protein secretion, energy production or antibiotic biosynthesis.},

Recently bacterial endosymbionts were documented in soilborne Glomeromycota and Mucoromycotina and in at least one species each of mycorrhizal Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. Here we show for the first time that phylogenetically diverse endohyphal bacteria occur in living hyphae of diverse foliar endophytes, including representatives of four classes of Ascomycota. We examined 414 isolates of endophytic fungi, isolated from photosynthetic tissues of six species of cupressaceous trees in five biogeographic provinces, for endohyphal bacteria using microscopy and molecular techniques. Viable bacteria were observed within living hyphae of endophytic Pezizomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Sordariomycetes from all tree species and biotic regions surveyed. A focus on 29 fungus/bacterium associations revealed that bacterial and fungal phylogenies were incongruent with each other and with taxonomic relationships of host plants. Overall, eight families and 15 distinct genotypes of endohyphal bacteria were recovered; most were members of the Proteobacteria, but a small number of Bacillaceae also were found, including one that appears to occur as an endophyte of plants. Frequent loss of bacteria following subculturing suggests a facultative association. Our study recovered distinct lineages of endohyphal bacteria relative to previous studies, is the first to document their occurrence in foliar endophytes representing four of the most species-rich classes of fungi, and highlights for the first time their diversity and phylogenetic relationships with regard both to the endophytes they inhabit and the plants in which these endophyte-bacterium symbiota occur.},

  abstract = {Fungi utilize polysaccharide substrates through extracellular digestion catalyzed by secreted enzymes. Thus far, protein secretion by the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger has mainly been studied at the level of individual proteins and by genome and transcriptome analyses. To extend these studies, a complementary proteomics approach was applied with the aim to investigate the changes in secretome and microsomal protein composition resulting from a shift to a high level secretion condition. During growth of A. niger on D-sorbitol, small amounts of D-maltose or D-xylose were used as inducers of the extracellular amylolytic and xylanolytic enzymes. Upon induction, protein compositions in the extracellular broth as well as in enriched secretory organelle (microsomal) fractions were analyzed using a shotgun proteomics approach. In total 102 secreted proteins and 1,126 microsomal proteins were identified in this study. Induction by D-maltose or D-xylose resulted in the increase in specific extracellular enzymes, such as glucoamylase A on D-maltose and b-xylosidase D on D-xylose, as well as of microsomal proteins. This reflects the differential expression of selected genes coding for dedicated extracellular enzymes. As expected, the addition of extra D-sorbitol had no effect on the expression of carbohydrate-active enzymes, compared to addition of D-xylose or D-maltose. Furthermore, D-maltose induction caused an increase in microsomal proteins related to translation (e.g., Rpl15) and vesicular transport (e. g., the endosomal-cargo receptor Erv14). Millimolar amounts of the inducers D-maltose and D-xylose are sufficient to cause a direct response in specific protein expression levels. Also, after induction by D-maltose or D-xylose, the induced enzymes were found in microsomes and extracellular. In agreement with our previous findings for D-xylose induction, D-maltose induction leads to recruitment of proteins involved in proteasome-mediated degradation.},

  abstract = {Background: Aspergillus fumigatus is a mold responsible for the majority of cases of aspergillosis in humans. To survive in the human body, A. fumigatus must adapt to microenvironments that are often characterized by low nutrient and oxygen availability. Recent research suggests that the ability of A. fumigatus and other pathogenic fungi to adapt to hypoxia contributes to their virulence. However, molecular mechanisms of A. fumigatus hypoxia adaptation are poorly understood. Thus, to better understand how A. fumigatus adapts to hypoxic microenvironments found in vivo during human fungal pathogenesis, the dynamic changes of the fungal transcriptome and proteome in hypoxia were investigated over a period of 24 hours utilizing an oxygen-controlled fermenter system. Results: Significant increases in transcripts associated with iron and sterol metabolism, the cell wall, the GABA shunt, and transcriptional regulators were observed in response to hypoxia. A concomitant reduction in transcripts was observed with ribosome and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism and RNA degradation. Analysis of changes in transcription factor mRNA abundance shows that hypoxia induces significant positive and negative changes that may be important for regulating the hypoxia response in this pathogenic mold. Growth in hypoxia resulted in changes in the protein levels of several glycolytic enzymes, but these changes were not always reflected by the corresponding transcriptional profiling data. However, a good correlation overall (R-2 = 0.2, p $<$ 0.05) existed between the transcriptomic and proteomics datasets for all time points. The lack of correlation between some transcript levels and their subsequent protein levels suggests another regulatory layer of the hypoxia response in A. fumigatus. Conclusions: Taken together, our data suggest a robust cellular response that is likely regulated both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level in response to hypoxia by the human pathogenic mold A. fumigatus. As with other pathogenic fungi, the induction of glycolysis and transcriptional down-regulation of the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation appear to major components of the hypoxia response in this pathogenic mold. In addition, a significant induction of the transcripts involved in ergosterol biosynthesis is consistent with previous observations in the pathogenic yeasts Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans indicating conservation of this response to hypoxia in pathogenic fungi. Because ergosterol biosynthesis enzymes also require iron as a cofactor, the increase in iron uptake transcripts is consistent with an increased need for iron under hypoxia. However, unlike C. albicans and C. neoformans, the GABA shunt appears to play an important role in reducing NADH levels in response to hypoxia in A. fumigatus and it will be intriguing to determine whether this is critical for fungal virulence. Overall, regulatory mechanisms of the A. fumigatus hypoxia response appear to involve both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of transcript and protein levels and thus provide candidate genes for future analysis of their role in hypoxia adaptation and fungal virulence.},

To understand the molecular basis for its formation and to develop a combinatorial biosynthetic system for this class of compounds, a 107.6 kb segment of the A. kijaniata chromosome containing the kijanimicin biosynthetic locus was identified, cloned, and sequenced. The complete pathway for the formation of TDP-L-digitoxose, one of the two sugar donors used in construction of kijanimicin, was elucidated through biochemical analysis of four enzymes encoded in the gene cluster. Sequence analysis indicates that the aglycone kijanolide is formed by the combined action of a modular Typed polyketide synthase, a conserved set of enzymes involved in formation, attachment, and intramolecular cyclization of a glycerate-derived three-carbon unit, which forms the core of the spirotetronate moiety. The genes involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual deoxysugar D-kijanose [2,3,4,6-tetradeoxy-4-(methyl carbamyl)-3-C-methyl-3-nitro-D-xylo-hexopyranose], including one encoding a flavoenzyme predicted to catalyze the formation of the nitro group, have also been identified.

The new ``omics'' era has provided the key to understand the underlying mechanisms of the industrial strain improvement process. The review of different proteomics methods applied to P. chrysogenum has revealed that industrial modification of this microorganism was a consequence of a careful rebalancing of several metabolic pathways.

The mechanisms for its pathogenicity are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the proteome of dormant A. fumigatus conidia as the fungal entity having the initial contact with the host. Applying two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE), we established a 2-D reference map of conidial proteins. By MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we identified a total number of 449 different proteins. We show that 57 proteins of our map are over-represented in resting conidia compared to mycelium. Enzymes involved in reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) detoxification, pigment biosynthesis, and conidial rodlet layer formation were highly abundant in A. fumigatus spores and most probably account for their enormous stress resistance. Interestingly, pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase were detectable in dormant conidia, suggesting that alcoholic fermentation plays a role during dormancy or early germination. Moreover, we show that enzymes for rapid reactivation of protein biosynthesis and metabolic processes are preserved in resting conidia, which therefore feature the potential to immediately respond to an environmental stimulus by germination. The generated data lay the foundations for further proteomic analyses and a better understanding of fungal pathogenesis.},

Mutants defective in type III secretion show reduced intracellular survival and fail to elicit sporulation of the host. Furthermore, genes coding for T3SS components are upregulated during cocultivation of the bacterial symbiont with their host. This is the first report on a T3SS involved in bacterial-fungal symbiosis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the T3SS represents a prototype of a clade of yet uncharacterized T3SSs within the hrp superfamily of T3SSs from plant pathogenic microorganisms.

Thus, the interactions between bacteria and fungi are of central importance to numerous biological questions in agriculture, forestry, environmental science, food production, and medicine. Here we present a structured review of bacterial-fungal interactions, illustrated by examples sourced from many diverse scientific fields. We consider the general and specific properties of these interactions, providing a global perspective across this emerging multidisciplinary research area. We show that in many cases, parallels can be drawn between different scenarios in which bacterial-fungal interactions are important.

  abstract = {The spatial distribution of plant defenses within a leaf may be critical in explaining patterns of herbivory. The generalist lepidopteran larvae, Helicoverpa armigera (the cotton bollworm), avoided the midvein and periphery of Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves and fed almost exclusively on the inner lamina. This feeding pattern was attributed to glucosinolates because it was not evident in a myrosinase mutant that lacks the ability to activate glucosinolate defenses by hydrolysis. To measure the spatial distribution of glucosinolates in A. thaliana leaves at a fine scale, we constructed ion intensity maps from MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight) mass spectra. The major glucosinolates were found to be more abundant in tissues of the midvein and the periphery of the leaf than the inner lamina, patterns that were validated by HPLC analyses of dissected leaves. In addition, there were differences in the proportions of the three major glucosinolates in different leaf regions. Hence, the distribution of glucosinolates within the leaf appears to control the feeding preference of H. armigera larvae. The preferential allocation of glucosinolates to the periphery may play a key role in the defense of leaves by creating a barrier to the feeding of chewing herbivores that frequently approach leaves from the edge.},

However, unlike other oral candidiasis, most DS patients have intact host immunity. The presence of a denture alone is usually sufficient for DS. Saliva and its protein contents can theoretically predispose some denture wearers to DS and others resistant toward DS. Here we proposed for the first time to define salivary proteomic profiles of denture wearers with and without DS. SELDI-TOF/MS analysis suggests that there is a proteomic differentiation among control, localized and generalized DS. Based on initial SELDI-TOF/MS profiling, we further used reversed phase liquid chromatography, MALDI-TOF/MS, and LC-MS/MS to characterize the salivary proteins associated with DS. Nineteen proteins based on SELDI-TOF/MS profiling were found including cystatin-SN, statherin, kininogen-1, desmocollin-2, carbonic anhydrase-6, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A like peptides, cystatin C, and several immunoglobulin fragments. The proteomic content gives evidence of the interaction between host tissue, saliva, and candida. Further examination in larger populations of these proteins may help to gain a better understanding of DS pathological processes and improve DS treatments.},

Appropriately, these unicellular eukaryotes express a variety of iron uptake systems, some of which are unique to fungi and some of which are present in plants and animals, as well. The reductive system of uptake relies upon the external reduction of ferric salts, chelates, and proteins prior to uptake by a high-affinity, ferrous-specific, oxidase/permease complex. This system recognizes a broad range of substrates. The non-reductive system exhibits specificity for siderophore-iron chelates, and transporters of this system exhibit multiple substrate-dependent intracellular trafficking events.

  abstract = {The oral cavity is a primary target for opportunistic infections, particularly oral candidiasis caused by Candida albicans. A commensal fungus commonly colonizing mucosal surfaces, under conditions of immune dysfunction, C. albicans can become a pathogen causing recurrent infections. Yet, the role of host oral innate immunity in the development of candidiasis is not fully elucidated. Specifically, the host salivary antimicrobial peptide histatin-5 (Hst-5) has been proposed to play a protective role in the oral cavity against C. albicans. However, investigations demonstrating its efficacy on oral tissue have been lacking. To this end, in this study, an ex vivo murine model of oral infection was developed. Viable C. albicans counts and histopathological analyses demonstrated a significant protective effect for Hst-5 on mouse oral tissue against C. albicans. More importantly, host saliva exerted a comparable anticandidal effect. However, this effect was neutralized upon treatment of saliva with proteases and C. albicans, previously shown to degrade Hst-5, indicating that Hst-5 is likely the salivary component responsible for the observed protection. Combined, the findings from this study demonstrate for the first time the efficacy of salivary Hst-5 in protecting host oral tissue against C. albicans infection, thereby affirming the therapeutic potential of this natural host peptide.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: In order to deepen the understanding of electrospray ionisation collision-induced dissociation (ESI-CID) fragmentation reactions of xanthine derivatives for the identification of metabolites using low-resolution liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis, basic experiments using caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) as model compound have been performed.
METHODS: Six deuterium isotopomers and one N1-ethylated homologue of caffeine have been synthesized and their ESI fragmentation spectra have been obtained by using LC/MS in combination with either standard or perdeuterated eluent mixtures.
RESULTS: One result of these studies is the finding that the positive charges of the ESI-CID caffeine fragments are caused by the addition of protons. Furthermore, the performed experiments allow the determination of all molecular formulae of each ESI-CID caffeine fragment.
CONCLUSIONS: As basic CID reactions of caffeine have been elucidated in this work, the developed fragmentation scheme may serve as a valuable tool for the interpretation of ESI-CID fragmentation spectra of more complex xanthine derivatives and their respective metabolites.

Several series of mimetics (with molecular weight $<$ 1000) were developed and screened against oral Candida strains as a proof-of-principle for their antifungal properties. One phenylalkyne and several arylamide compounds with reduced mammalian cytotoxicities were found to be active against C. albicans. These compounds demonstrated rapid fungicidal activity in liquid culture even in the presence of saliva, and demonstrated synergy with standard antifungal agents. When assayed against biofilms grown on denture acrylic, the compounds exhibited potent fungicidal activity as measured by metabolic and fluorescent viability assays. Repeated passages in sub-minimum inhibitory concentration levels did not lead to resistant Candida, in contrast to fluconazole. Our results demonstrate the proof-of principle for the use of these compounds as anti-Candida agents, and their further testing is warranted as novel anti-Candida therapies.},

This hampers our understanding of plant metabolism and dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate that desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) of tissue imprints on porous Teflon may be used to accurately image the distribution of even labile plant metabolites such as hydroxynitrile glucosides, which normally undergo enzymatic hydrolysis by specific $\beta$-glucosidases upon cell disruption. This fast and simple sample preparation resulted in no substantial differences in the distribution and ratios of all hydroxynitrile glucosides between leaves from wild-type Lotus japonicus and a $\beta$-glucosidase mutant plant that lacks the ability to hydrolyze certain hydroxynitrile glucosides. In wild-type, the enzymatic conversion of hydroxynitrile glucosides and the concomitant release of glucose were easily visualized when a restricted area of the leaf tissue was damaged prior to sample preparation. The gene encoding the first enzyme in hydroxynitrile glucoside biosynthesis in L.~japonicus leaves, CYP79D3, was found to be highly expressed during the early stages of leaf development, and the hydroxynitrile glucoside distribution in mature leaves reflected this early expression pattern. The utility of direct DESI-MSI of plant tissue was demonstrated using cryo-sections of cassava (Manihot esculenta) tubers. The hydroxynitrile glucoside levels were highest in the outer cell layers, as verified by LC-MS analyses. The unexpected discovery of a hydroxynitrile-derived di-glycoside shows the potential of DESI-MSI to discover and guide investigations into new metabolic routes.},

  abstract = {Bacteria belonging to the Vibrionaceae family are widespread in the marine environment. Today, 128 species of vibrios are known. Several of them are infamous for their pathogenicity or symbiotic relationships. Despite their ability to interact with eukaryotes, the vibrios are greatly underexplored for their ability to produce bioactive secondary metabolites and studies have been limited to only a few species. Most of the compounds isolated from vibrios so far are non-ribosomal peptides or hybrids thereof, with examples of N-containing compounds produced independent of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). Though covering a limited chemical space, vibrios produce compounds with attractive biological activities, including antibacterial, anticancer, and antivirulence activities. This review highlights some of the most interesting structures from this group of bacteria. Many compounds found in vibrios have also been isolated from other distantly related bacteria. This cosmopolitan occurrence of metabolites indicates a high incidence of horizontal gene transfer, which raises interesting questions concerning the ecological function of some of these molecules. This account underlines the pending potential for exploring new bacterial sources of bioactive compounds and the challenges related to their investigation.},

  abstract = {Although human perception of food flavors involves integration of multiple sensory inputs, the most salient sensations are taste and olfaction. Ortho- and retronasal olfaction are particularly crucial to flavor because they provide the qualitative diversity so important to identify safe versus dangerous foods. Historically, flavor research has prioritized aroma volatiles present at levels exceeding the orthonasally measured odor threshold, ignoring the variation in the rate at which odor intensities grow above threshold. Furthermore, the chemical composition of a food in itself tells us very little about whether or not that food will be liked. Clearly, alternative approaches are needed to elucidate flavor chemistry. Here we use targeted metabolomics and natural variation in flavor-associated sugars, acids, and aroma volatiles to evaluate the chemistry of tomato fruits, creating a predictive and testable model of liking. This nontraditional approach provides novel insights into flavor chemistry, the interactions between taste and retronasal olfaction, and a paradigm for enhancing liking of natural products. Some of the most abundant volatiles do not contribute to consumer liking, whereas other less abundant ones do. Aroma volatiles make contributions to perceived sweetness independent of sugar concentration, suggesting a novel way to increase perception of sweetness without adding sugar.},

  abstract = {Secondary metabolites, including toxins and melanins, have been implicated as virulence attributes in invasive aspergillosis. Although not definitively proved, this supposition is supported by the decreased virulence of an Aspergillus fumigatus strain, Delta laeA, that is crippled in the production of numerous secondary metabolites. However, loss of a single LaeA-regulated toxin, gliotoxin, did not recapitulate the hypovirulent Delta laeA pathotype, thus implicating other toxins whose production is governed by LaeA. Toward this end, a whole-genome comparison of the transcriptional profile of wild-type, Delta laeA, and complemented control strains showed that genes in 13 of 22 secondary metabolite gene clusters, including several A. fumigatus-specific mycotoxin clusters, were expressed at significantly lower levels in the DlaeA mutant. LaeA influences the expression of at least 9.5\% of the genome (943 of 9,626 genes in A. fumigatus) but positively controls expression of 20\% to 40\% of major classes of secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes such as nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), polyketide synthases, and P450 monooxygenases. Tight regulation of NRPS-encoding genes was highlighted by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR analysis. In addition, expression of a putative siderophore biosynthesis NRPS (NRPS2/sidE) was greatly reduced in the DlaeA mutant in comparison to controls under inducing iron-deficient conditions. Comparative genomic analysis showed that A. fumigatus secondary metabolite gene clusters constitute evolutionarily diverse regions that may be important for niche adaptation and virulence attributes. Our findings suggest that LaeA is a novel target for comprehensive modification of chemical diversity and pathogenicity.},

Part of their impact on human well-being stems from the production of small molecular weight secondary metabolites, which may contribute to the ability of these fungi to cause invasive fungal infections and allergic diseases. In this study, we identified one group of enzymes responsible for secondary metabolite production in five Aspergillus species, the non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). Hidden Markov models were used to search the genome databases of A. funtigatus, A. flavus, A. terreus, A. nidulans, and A. oryzae for domains conserved in NRPS proteins. A genealogy of adenylation domains was utilized to identify orthologous and unique NRPS among the Aspergillus species examined, as well as gain an understanding of the potential evolution of Aspergillus NRPS. mRNA abundance of the 14 NRPS identified in the A. Jumigatus genome was analyzed using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR in different environmental conditions to gain a preliminary understanding of the possible functions of the NRPSs' peptide products. Our results suggest that Aspergillus species contain conserved and unique NRPS genes with a complex evolutionary history. This result suggests that the genus Aspergillus produces a substantial diversity of nonribosomally synthesized peptides. Further analysis of these genes and their peptide products may identify important roles for secondary metabolites produced by NRPS in Aspergillus physiology, ecology, and fungal pathogenicity.

The caffeine content was determined by means of two spectrophotometric methods, as well as HPLC analysis. Additionally, raw caffeine was also obtained by an isolation procedure with chloroform. Cherry coffee, a variety of C. canephora exhibited the highest overall content of total phenols (42.37 mg GAE/g), followed by Minas coffee, while Cioccolatato contained the lowest TPC (33.12 mg GAE/g). Cherry coffee also exhibited the highest content of individual classes of polyphenols (flavan-3-ols, procyanidins and tannins), while the highest content of chlorogenic acid (CQA) derivatives was determined in Minas and Cioccolatato coffees (C. arabica). The highest content of total and individual polyphenolic compounds was determined in coffees roasted in both light and medium roasting conditions, which was also observed for the content of CQA derivatives and antioxidant capacity of roasted coffees. The highest caffeine content in the coffee samples was determined by employing the HPLC analysis (0.06\textendash{}2.55\%).

This study reports investigations into the effect of several solvent/derivatization agent combinations on extractable TDI results and suggests a preferred method. The suggested preferred method employs a syringe-based multiple extraction of foam samples with a toluene solution of 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazine. Extracts are analyzed by liquid chromatography using an ion trap mass spectrometry detection technique. Detection limits of the method are \textasciitilde{}10ng TDI g(-1) foam (10 ppb, w/w) for each TDI isomer (i.e. 2,4-TDI and 2,6-TDI). The method was evaluated by a three-laboratory interlaboratory comparison using two representative foam samples. The total extractable TDI results found by the three labs for the two foams were in good agreement (relative standard deviation of the mean of 30-40\%). The method has utility as a basis for comparing FPFs, but the interpretation of extractable TDI results using any solvent as the true value for 'free' or 'unreacted' TDI in the foam is problematic, as demonstrated by the difference in the extracted TDI results from the different extraction systems studied. Further, a consideration of polyurethane foam chemistry raises the possibility that extractable TDI may result from decomposition of parts of the foam structure (e.g. dimers, biurets, and allophanates) by the extraction system.},

The N-oxygenase, AurF, from Streptomyces thioluteus catalyzes the six-electron oxidation of p-aminobenzoate to p-nitrobenzoate and contains the EX2HX60-180EX2H sequence motif previously used to identify proteins with non-heme diiron clusters. Two research groups independently obtained evidence for the presence of iron and manganese in preparations of AurF. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of purified, resting AmF presented in one of these studies is markedly similar to the spectrum of the Mn-III/Fe-III form of C. trachomatis R2. We propose that S. thioluteus AurF also may harbor a heterodinuclear Mn/Fe cofactor, which it may use to activate O-2 for oxidation of the aryl amine to the nitro compound. Hypothetical proteins encoded in the genomes of several other bacteria have similar sequences and may also be members of this nascent family of oxygen-activating Mn/Fe proteins.},

Herein, we present ambient ion/molecule reactions performed in the course of low-temperature plasma (LTP) ionization of condensed-phase analytes in order to increase the specificity of LTP-based ambient analysis.
METHODS: The ion population of the cold plasma is modified by addition of a reagent to the plasma before it is directed at a surface bearing the analyte. Desorbed ions were analyzed using linear ion trap-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICRMS).
RESULTS: Acylium ions generated from tetramethylurea react with 1,3-dioxane analyte to afford distinctive Eberlin product ions. Reactions of alkylamines, such as n-hexylamine and n-octylamine, with benzaldehyde produce the corresponding imines. Reaction of ruthenocene with trifluoroacetic anhydride forms the unusual trifluoroacetate ruthenocene.
CONCLUSIONS: A LTP source can be used to generate reagent ions that can undergo ion/molecule reactions in the ambient environment with an analyte at condensed phase on a surface. The experiment is a 'reactive' version of the standard low-temperature plasma (LTP) ambient ionization experiment. This approach provides additional information by combining ion/molecule chemistry with conventional MS and MS/MS data to characterize particular analytes.},

This research was conducted to investigate the use of post-harvest insect resistance maize in combination with biological control of P. truncatus by the predator Teretrius nigrescens to reduce maize storage losses. We studied the population dynamics of P. truncatus with and without a predator in combination with susceptible maize and resistant maize to insects under laboratory conditions. This study confirms that P84c3 is a resistant variety against P. truncatus. Maize resistant kernels had a reduction of 30\% losses in comparison with susceptible kernels. Significant and favorable interactions were observed between P84c3 maize and presence of T nigrescens. A dramatic reduction of 80\% in progeny number, 81\% grain weight loss, and 75\% frass production caused by P truncatus was observed when the predator was used in combination with P84c3. Resistant maize reduced the prey development time and consequently the insect density allowing the predator to control more effectively the population. Prey/predator proportion on resistant maize was significantly higher in comparison with susceptible kernels; thus, giving a more effective pest population control by the predator. These results demonstrated that the combination of post-harvest insect resistance maize with the predator T. nigrescens reduces grain maize losses by P. truncatus. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

By MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer, 26 proteins were identified, including 8 persistently up-regulated, four persistently down-regulated, 12 with fluctuating regulation, and 2 with significant differential expression but with no match in the published fowl databases.

Interestingly, most stress and immune-associated proteins, such as apolipoprotein A-1, were significantly down-regulated, but tumor-associated proteins were significantly increased at 14 days post-infection (d.p.i), and at 21 d.p.i. These findings provide a basis for further studies to elucidate the role of these proteins in MDV-host interaction.

  doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-8-105},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structure elucidation of unknown small molecules by mass spectrometry is a challenge despite advances in instrumentation. The first crucial step is to obtain correct elemental compositions. In order to automatically constrain the thousands of possible candidate structures, rules need to be developed to select the most likely and chemically correct molecular formulas.
RESULTS: An algorithm for filtering molecular formulas is derived from seven heuristic rules: (1) restrictions for the number of elements, (2) LEWIS and SENIOR chemical rules, (3) isotopic patterns, (4) hydrogen/carbon ratios, (5) element ratio of nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor, and sulphur versus carbon, (6) element ratio probabilities and (7) presence of trimethylsilylated compounds. Formulas are ranked according to their isotopic patterns and subsequently constrained by presence in public chemical databases. The seven rules were developed on 68,237 existing molecular formulas and were validated in four experiments. First, 432,968 formulas covering five million PubChem database entries were checked for consistency. Only 0.6\% of these compounds did not pass all rules. Next, the rules were shown to effectively reducing the complement all eight billion theoretically possible C, H, N, S, O, P-formulas up to 2000 Da to only 623 million most probable elemental compositions. Thirdly 6,000 pharmaceutical, toxic and natural compounds were selected from DrugBank, TSCA and DNP databases. The correct formulas were retrieved as top hit at 80-99\% probability when assuming data acquisition with complete resolution of unique compounds and 5\% absolute isotope ratio deviation and 3 ppm mass accuracy. Last, some exemplary compounds were analyzed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and by gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry. In each case, the correct formula was ranked as top hit when combining the seven rules with database queries.
CONCLUSION: The seven rules enable an automatic exclusion of molecular formulas which are either wrong or which contain unlikely high or low number of elements. The correct molecular formula is assigned with a probability of 98\% if the formula exists in a compound database. For truly novel compounds that are not present in databases, the correct formula is found in the first three hits with a probability of 65-81\%.

  abstract = {The dermatophytes are a group of closely related fungi which are responsible for the great majority of superficial mycoses in humans and animals. Among various potential virulence factors, their secreted proteolytic activity attracts a lot of attention. Most dermatophyte-secreted proteases which have so far been isolated in vitro are neutral or alkaline enzymes. However, inspection of the recently decoded dermatophyte genomes revealed many other hypothetical secreted proteases, in particular acidic proteases similar to those characterized in Aspergillus spp. The validation of such genome predictions instigated the present study on two dermatophyte species, Microsporum canis and Arthroderma benhamiae. Both fungi were found to grow well in a protein medium at acidic pH, accompanied by extracellular proteolysis. Shotgun MS analysis of secreted protein revealed fundamentally different protease profiles during fungal growth in acidic versus neutral pH conditions. Most notably, novel dermatophyte-secreted proteases were identified at acidic pH such as pepsins, sedolisins and acidic carboxypeptidases. Therefore, our results not only support genome predictions, but demonstrate for the first time the secretion of acidic proteases by dermatophytes. Our findings also suggest the existence of different pathways of protein degradation into amino acids and short peptides in these highly specialized pathogenic fungi.},

However, the exact pathogenicity mechanisms that this fungus employs are largely unknown and many of the genes expressed during oral infection are uncharacterized. In this study we sought to functionally characterize 12 previously unknown function genes associated with oral candidiasis. We generated homozygous knockout mutants for all 12 genes and analyzed their interaction with human oral epithelium in vitro. Eleven mutants caused significantly less epithelial damage and, of these, deletion of orf19.6656 (DUR31) elicited the strongest reduction in pathogenicity. Interestingly, DUR31 was not only involved in oral epithelial damage, but in multiple stages of candidiasis, including surviving attack by human neutrophils, endothelial damage and virulence in vivo. In silico analysis indicated that DUR31 encodes a sodium/substrate symporter with 13 transmembrane domains and no human homologue. We provide evidence that Dur31 transports histatin 5. This is one of the very first examples of microbial driven import of this highly cytotoxic antimicrobial peptide. Also, in contrast to wild type C. albicans, dur31 Delta/Delta was unable to actively increase local environmental pH, suggesting that Dur31 lies in the extracellular alkalinization hyphal auto-induction pathway; and, indeed, DUR31 was required for morphogenesis. In agreement with this observation, dur31 Delta/Delta was unable to assimilate the polyamine spermidine.},

  abstract = {A novel method for assessing the statistical significance of mass spectral similarities was developed using modified basic local alignment search tool (BLAST; Karlin?Altschul) statistics. In gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, many signals in raw metabolome data are identified on the basis of unexpected similarities among mass spectra and the spectra of standards. Since there is inevitably noise in the observed spectra, a list of identified metabolites includes some false positives. In the developed method, electron ionization (EI) mass spectrometry?BLAST, a similarity score of two mass spectra is calculated using a general scoring scheme, from which the probability of obtaining the score by chance (P value) is calculated. For this purpose, a simple rule for converting a unit EI mass spectrum to a mass spectral sequence as well as a score matrix for aligned mass spectral sequences was developed. A Monte Carlo simulation using randomly generated mass spectral sequences demonstrated that the null distribution or the expected number of hits (E value) follows modified Karlin?Altschul statistics. A metabolite data set obtained from green tea extract was analyzed using the developed method. Among 171 metabolite signals in the metabolome data, 93 signals were identified on the basis of significant similarities (P $<$ 0.015) with reference data. Since the expected number of false positives is 2.6, the false discovery rate was estimated to be 2.8\%, indicating that the search threshold (P $<$ 0.015) is reasonable for metabolite identification.},

They can coexist with their hosts for many years without causing significant symptoms but also cause highly inflammatory diseases. To identify mechanisms involved in the modulation of the host response during infection caused by the zoophilic dermatophyte Arthroderma benhamiae, cell wall-associated surface proteins were studied. By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we found that a hydrophobin protein designated HypA was the dominant cell surface protein. HypA was also detected in the supernatant during the growth and conidiation of the fungus. The A. benhamiae genome harbors only a single hydrophobin gene, designated hypA. A hypA deletion mutant was generated, as was a complemented hypA mutant strain (hypA(C)). In contrast to the wild type and the complemented strain, the hypA deletion mutant exhibited ``easily wettable'' mycelia and conidia, indicating the loss of surface hydrophobicity of both morphotypes. Compared with the wild type, the hypA deletion mutant triggered an increased activation of human neutrophil granulocytes and dendritic cells, characterized by an increased release of the immune mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). For the first time, we observed the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps against dermatophytes, whose level of formation was increased by the Delta hypA mutant compared with the wild type. Furthermore, conidia of the Delta hypA strain were killed more effectively by neutrophils. Our data suggest that the recognition of A. benhamiae by the cellular immune defense system is notably influenced by the presence of the surface rodlet layer formed by the hydrophobin HypA.},

Carbohydrates and amino acids usually function in the attraction of mutualists and appear adapted to the physiological needs of the respective mutualists. Volatiles are a further group of compounds that serves in the attractive function of nectars.

Software solutions for these tasks were developed using functions in MATLAB. Peak detection and peak alignment were applied to reduce the data size, while retaining the mass accuracy. The main morphologic features of tissue sections were extracted using a classification method for data alignment. Data insertion was performed to construct a 3D data set with spectral information that can be used for generating 3D views and for data analysis. The imaging data previously obtained for a mouse brain using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) imaging have been used to test and demonstrate the new methodology.},

  abstract = {Plants secrete nectar to attract pollinators and indirect defenders. The chemical contents of both floral and extrafloral nectar appear adapted to attract and nourish these two classes of animal mutualists. Being rich in sugars and amino acids, however, nectar also requires protection from nectar robbers and infecting micro-organisms. This role is mainly fulfilled by nectar proteins (nectarins) and by secondary compounds such as alkaloids. Although much on the chemical ecology of nectar and the phenotypic patterns of its secretion is known, we have only limited knowledge on the molecular control of the synthesis of nectar components and of nectar secretion. Likewise, carbohydrates are uploaded from the phloem into the nectariferous tissue, where they might move via an apoplastic or a vesicle-bound, symplastic pathway. Cell wall invertases play a central role in creating the required source\textendash{}sink relations and controlling the sucrose/hexose ratio of nectars. No information exits on the sites of synthesis of non-carbohydrate nectar components such as proteins and alkaloids, although it appears likely that at least the bulk of nectarins is synthesized in the nectariferous tissue itself. Most of the common model species do not depend on nectar secretion, and it might be this fact that has hindered nectar research over the last 50 years. We recommend the use of contemporary ``omics'' techniques in comparative approaches to understand how plants synthesize and secrete nectar.},

  abstract = {The biosynthesis of capsaicinoids in the placenta of chilli fruit is modelled to require components of the fatty acid synthase (FAS) complex. Three candidate genes for subunits in this complex, Kas, Acl, and Fat, isolated based on differential expression, were characterized. Transcription of these three genes was placental-specific and RNA abundance was positively correlated with degree of pungency. Kas and Acl were mapped to linkage group 1 and Fat to linkage group 6. None of the genes is linked to the pungency locus, C, on linkage group 2. KAS accumulation was positively correlated with pungency. Western blots of placental extracts and histological sections both demonstrated that the accumulation of this enzyme was correlated with fruit pungency and KAS was immunolocalized to the expected cell layer, the placental epidermis. Enzyme activity of the recombinant form of the placental-specific KAS was confirmed using crude cell extracts. These FAS components are fruit-specific members of their respective gene families. These genes are predicted to be associated with Capsicum fruit traits, for example, capsaicinoid biosynthesis or fatty acid biosynthesis necessary for placental development.},

To directly assess the role of the cell wall we have increased the expression and activity of a cell wall associated peroxidase (TPX2), an enzyme involved in modifying cell wall architecture. Overexpression of TPX2 had no effect on wild-type development, but greatly increased the germination rate under high salt or osmotic stress. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that transgenic seeds were able to retain more water available for germination than wild-type seeds. Thermoporometry calculations indicated that this could be due to a lower mean pore size in the walls of transgenic seeds. Therefore, the higher capacity of transgenic seeds in retaining water could result in higher germination rates in conditions where the availability of water is restricted.},

The various approaches and programs published for calculating such isotope distributions are complex or of limited applicability or have insufficient accuracy because of rounding errors, or need too much calculation time. The algorithm described here is simple, easy to understand, highly accurate and extremely fast. Instead of the known procedures involving stepwise development or expansion of polynomial expressions, the isotope distributions are calculated by combining precalculated patterns of hypothetical atom clusters. For large organic molecules, the calculation time is reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to the stepwise procedure, and accuracy is increased compared to the use of polynomial expressions with inappropriate neglect of smaller terms. Typical examples are discussed to illustrate the scope and limitations of this approach. Additional features of the program are the calculation of isotope peak patterns of mixtures and the calculation of high-resolution masses and intensities for any mass within a given isotope distribution.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The growing interest in the field of proteomics has increased the demand for software tools and applications that process and analyze the resulting data. And even though the purpose of these tools can vary significantly, they usually share a basic set of features, including the handling of protein and peptide sequences, the visualization of (and interaction with) spectra and chromatograms, and the parsing of results from various proteomics search engines. Developers typically spend considerable time and effort implementing these support structures, which detracts from working on the novel aspects of their tool.
RESULTS: In order to simplify the development of proteomics tools, we have implemented an open-source support library for computational proteomics, called compomics-utilities. The library contains a broad set of features required for reading, parsing, and analyzing proteomics data. compomics-utilities is already used by a long list of existing software, ensuring library stability and continued support and development.
CONCLUSIONS: As a user-friendly, well-documented and open-source library, compomics-utilities greatly simplifies the implementation of the basic features needed in most proteomics tools. Implemented in 100\% Java, compomics-utilities is fully portable across platforms and architectures. Our library thus allows the developers to focus on the novel aspects of their tools, rather than on the basic functions, which can contribute substantially to faster development, and better tools for proteomics.},

We have previously characterized an amaranth cystatin cDNA and analyzed its response to different kinds of abiotic stress [37]. In order to characterize amaranth cystatin, the coding sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli using the pQE-2 vector. Recombinant cystatin was predominantly found in the soluble fraction of the cell extract. Large amounts (266~mgL-1) of pure recombinant protein were obtained by affinity chromatography in a single step of purification. The amaranth cystatin with a pI 6.8 and an apparent 28~kDa molecular mass inhibited papain (E.C.3.4.22.2) (Ki 115~nM), ficin (E.C.3.4.22.3) (Ki 325~nM) and cathepsin L (E.C.3.4.22.15) (Ki 12.7~nM) but not stem bromelain (E.C.3.4.22.32), and cathepsin B (E.C.3.4.22.1) activities, in colorimetric assays. Furthermore, it was able to arrest the fungal growth of Fusarium oxysporum, Sclerotium cepivorum and Rhyzoctonia solani. It was further demonstrated that recombinant AhCPI is a weak inhibitor of the endogenous cysteine proteinase activities in the fungal mycelium. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the amaranth cystatin activity and encourage further studies of this protein.},

All aerobic organisms have evolved the ability to regulate the levels of these toxic intermediates, whereas some have evolved elaborate signalling pathways to dramatically increase the levels of ROS and use them as weapons in mounting a defence response, a process commonly referred to as the oxidative burst. The balance between steady state levels of ROS and the exponential increase in these levels during the oxidative burst has begun to shed light on complex signalling networks mediated by these molecules. Here, we discuss the different sources of ROS that are present in plant cells and review their role in the oxidative burst. We further describe two well-studied ROS generating systems, the NADPH oxidase and apoplastic peroxidase proteins, and their role as the primary producers of ROS during pathogen invasion. We then discuss what is known about the metabolic and proteomic fluxes that occur in plant cells during the oxidative burst and after pathogen recognition, and try to highlight underlying biochemical processes that may provide more insight on the complex regulation of ROS in plants.},

The cell wall of A. fumigatus has been studied intensively as a potential target for development of effective antifungal agents. A major role in maintaining cell wall integrity is played by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) MpkA. To gain a comprehensive insight into this central signal transduction pathway, we performed a transcriptome analysis of the Delta mpkA mutant under standard and cell wall stress conditions. Besides genes involved in cell wall remodelling, protection against ROS and secondary metabolism such as gliotoxin, pyomelanin and pseurotin A, also genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis were regulated by MpkA. Consistently, northern and western blot analyses indicated that iron starvation triggers phosphorylation and thus activation of MpkA. Furthermore, localization studies indicated that MpkA accumulates in the nucleus under iron depletion. Hence, we report the first connection between a MAPK pathway and siderophore biosynthesis. The measurement of amino acid pools and of the pools of polyamines indicated that arginine was continuously converted into ornithine to fuel the siderophore pool in the Delta mpkA mutant strain. Based on our data, we propose that MpkA fine-tunes the balance between stress response and energy consuming cellular processes.},

  abstract = {Dermatophytes are keratinophilic fungi that can be pathogenic for humans and animals by infecting the stratum corneum, nails, claws or hair. The first infection step consists of adherence of arthroconidia to the stratum corneum. The mechanisms and the kinetics of adherence have been investigated using different in vitro and ex vivo experimental models, most notably showing the role of a secreted serine protease from Microsporum canis in fungal adherence to feline corneocytes. After germination of the arthroconidia, dermatophytes invade keratinised structures that have to be digested into short peptides and amino acids to be assimilated. Although many proteases, including keratinolytic ones, have been characterised, the understanding of dermatophyte invasion mechanisms remains speculative. To date, research on mechanisms of dermatophyte infection focused mainly on both secreted endoproteases and exoproteases, but their precise role in both fungal adherence and skin invasion should be further explored.},

The effect of 10 microliters per liter ethylene was inhibited by 1 millimolar silver thiosulfate, an inhibitor of ethylene action. An increase in proteins with molecular weights of 33 to 30 kilodaltons and lower molecular weights (25, 23, 20, 16, 12, and 10 kilodaltons) were observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels after ethylene enhanced senescence. The measurement of DNase and RNase activity in gels indicated that these new proteins were not nucleases. Two proteins from ethylene-treated cotyledons were purified on the basis of their association with a red chromaphore and subsequently were identified as peroxidases. The molecular weights and isoelectric points (pI) of two of these peroxidases were 33 kilodaltons (cationic, pI = 8.9) and 60 kilodaltons (anionic, pI = 4.0). The observation that [35S]Na2SO4 was incorporated into these proteins during ethylene-enhanced senescence suggests that these peroxidases represent newly synthesized proteins. Antibodies to the 33-kilodalton peroxidase precipitated two in vitro translation products from RNA isolated from ethylene-treated but not from control cucumber seedlings. This indicates that the increase in 33-kilodalton peroxidase activity represents de novo protein synthesis. Both forms of peroxidase degraded chlorophyll in vitro, which is consistent with the hypothesis that peroxidases have catabolic or scavenging functions in senescent tissues.},

  abstract = {Transgenic tobacco plants that overproduce the tobacco anionic peroxidase wilt upon reaching maturity, although having functional stomata and normal vascular anatomy and physiology. These plants were examined further to determine the cause for wilting, and thus better understand how the anionic peroxidase functions in plant growth and development. Shoots from young peroxidase overproducing plants were grafted onto wild-type tobacco root stock to determine if the roots could absorb and transmit sufficient water to maintain leaf turgidity. These grafted plants never wilted when grown in the greenhouse though shoot peroxidase activity remained ten-fold greater than in control plants, thus indicating that wilting is a consequence of peroxidase expression in the roots. Close examination of root systems revealed considerably less root mass in the transformed plant, primarily exhibited through a decrease in branching. At flowering, root growth rate and total root mass in transformed plants were less than 50\% of control plants although shoot mass and growth rate were unchanged. This is in contrast to root growth in young seedlings where transformed plants performed equivalently to controls. Root hydraulic conductivity was measured to evaluate the effect of elevated peroxidase expression on water absorption and transport; however, no significant change in hydraulic conductivity was found in transformed plants. The consequence of anionic peroxidase overexpression on indoleacetic acid (IAA) metabolism was also examined. No significant difference in IAA levels was observed; however, root elongation in plants overexpressing peroxidase was insensitive to exogenous IAA. It can be concluded that the overexpression of the tobacco anionic peroxidase in transformed plants results in diminished root mass from fewer root branches, which contributes to the wilting phenomenon seen in these plants. Further, this developmental change in transformed plants may be a consequence of the metabolism of IAA by the anionic peroxidase.},

  abstract = {Class III peroxidases (PRXs) are plant-specific enzymes that play key roles in the responses to biotic and abiotic stress during plant growth and development. In this study, we identified 119 nonredundant PRX genes (designated ZmPRXs). These PRX genes were divided into 18 groups based on their phylogenetic relationships. We performed systematic bioinformatics analysis of the PRX genes, including analysis of gene structures, conserved motifs, phylogenetic relationships and gene expression profiles. The ZmPRXs are unevenly distributed on the 10 maize chromosomes. In addition, these genes have undergone 16 segmental duplication and 12 tandem duplication events, indicating that both segmental and tandem duplication were the main contributors to the expansion of the maize PRX family. Ka/Ks analysis suggested that most duplicated ZmPRXs experienced purifying selection, with limited functional divergence during the duplication events, and comparative analysis among maize, sorghum and rice revealed that there were independent duplication events besides the whole-genome duplication of the maize genome. Furthermore, microarray analysis indicated that most highly expressed genes might play significant roles in root. We examined the expression of five candidate ZmPRXs under H2O2, SA, NaCl and PEG stress conditions using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), revealing differential expression patterns. This study provides useful information for further functional analysis of the PRX gene family in maize.},

African mahogany (Khaya ivorensis) was then introduced for Amazon reforestation and the commercialization of such wood is legal, thus creating a challenging problem for wood certification. Herein we report that a wood chemotaxonomic method based on distinct profiles of phytochemical markers is able to promptly characterize both the native and foreign mahogany species. This challenging task has been performed via a simple, fast and unambiguous methodology using direct electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis of a simple methanolic extract of a tiny wood chip. Typical limonoids such as khivorin, khayanolide A and mexicanolide for African mahogany and phragmalin-type limonoids for the native Brazilian species, as well as distinct polyphenols such as catechin derivatives and cinchonain, form the characteristic phytochemical marker pools for both species. This rapid methodology could therefore be used to monitor legal and illegal mahogany tree harvesting, and hence to control Amazon deforestation. It could also be applied to create a wood certification program for African and Brazilian mahogany trees, as well as for wood certification in general.},

In combining activity-directed protein purification, genomic and proteomic tools we found that protein B6T173 (ZmPrx35) is responsible for the majority of the POD activity of the kernel. We successfully produced recombinant ZmPrx35 protein in Escherichia coli and demonstrate both, in vitro activity and the presence of a haem (heme) cofactor of the enzyme.

Proteomics continues to be a rapidly expanding field, with a wealth of reports regularly appearing on technology enhancements and scientific studies using these new tools. This review focuses primarily on the quantitative aspect of protein expression and the associated computational machinery for making large-scale identifications of proteins and their post-translational modifications. The primary emphasis is on the combination of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods and associated tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Tandem mass spectrometry, or MS/MS, involves a second analysis within the instrument after a molecular dissociative event in order to obtain structural information including but not limited to sequence information. This review further focuses primarily on the study of in vitro digested proteins known as bottom-up or shotgun proteomics. A brief discussion of recent instrumental improvements precedes a discussion on affinity enrichment and depletion of proteins, followed by a review of the major approaches (label-free and isotope-labeling) to making protein expression measurements quantitative, especially in the context of profiling large numbers of proteins. Then a discussion follows on the various computational techniques used to identify peptides and proteins from LC-MS/MS data. This review article then includes a short discussion of LC-MS approaches to three-dimensional structure determination and concludes with a section on statistics and data mining for proteomics, including comments on properly powering clinical studies and avoiding over-fitting with large data sets.},

Scientific theories are said to be systems of statements which logically imply some singular, existential propositions which in principle could be falsified by empirical observations. Metaphysical theories lack such implications but many scientific theories have been derived historically from metaphysical speculations. The latter are not meaningless but only untestable as initially formulated. No scientific theory is established as a truth about reality, but is vindicated for the purposes of a discipline by repeated failures to falsify it by means of approved empirical methods. The probability value of theories is interpreted in parallel terms. The concepts of testability and simplicity are systematically examined. Applications are made to a number of controversies in recent and contemporary physics. Some attempt is made to show the relationship between the defended position and the positions of various historical thinkers and schools of thought.

  volume = {27},
  doi = {10.1002/rcm.6632},
  abstract = {RATIONALE The rapid analysis of volatile compounds, such as fragrances, is important in many commercial industries. The various ambient ionization methods have until now been largely applied to non-volatile or low-volatile compounds with success, and this study develops a semi-quantitative method for volatile compounds in commercial cleaning products. METHODS Low-temperature plasma (LTP) ionization was used to perform rapid analysis, determine limits of detection (LODs) and perform chemical imaging on eight fragrances. Several mass analyzers including an ion trap, a quadrupole and an orbitrap were used to rapidly screen volatile compounds from cloth, paper, and glass and determine compositions present in a commercial cleaning product. Peltier cooling was used in some cases to enhance the retention time of compounds on a surface. RESULTS This LTP method allowed the detection of fragrances in low picogram absolute amounts from glass, paper and cloth. Quantitation was demonstrated for compounds in a commercial cleaning product 1 min after the product was applied to a vinyl tile surface. High-throughput analysis and simultaneous detection of multiple compounds in a mixture were demonstrated with analysis times of less than 1 min. Modest spatial resolution (better than 1 cm) was achieved with LTP ionization. CONCLUSIONS A semi-quantitative method has been demonstrated for the routine analysis of volatile and semi-volatile compounds. This method would be useful in quality control and production environments to determine product persistence, location of analytes and to complement olfactory studies for determining concentrations in the ambient environment.

  abstract = {Clustering is often useful for analyzing and summarizing information within large datasets. Model-based clustering methods have been found to be effective for determining the number of clusters, dealing with outliers, and selecting the best clustering method in datasets that are small to moderate in size. For large datasets, current model-based clustering methods tend to be limited by memory and time requirements and the increasing difficulty of maximum likelihood estimation. They may fit too many clusters in some portions of the data and/or miss clusters containing relatively few observations. We propose an incremental approach for data that can be processed as a whole in memory, which is relatively efficient computationally and has the ability to find small clusters in large datasets. The method starts by drawing a random sample of the data, selecting and fitting a clustering model to the sample, and extending the model to the full dataset by additional EM iterations. New clusters are then added incrementally, initialized with the observations that are poorly fit by the current model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to simulated data, and to image data where its performance can be assessed visually.},

  abstract = {There is a contradiction between Darwin's methodology and how he described it for public consumption. Darwin claimed that he proceeded "on true Baconian [inductive] principles and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale." He also wrote, "How odd it is that anyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service!" The scientific method includes 2 episodes. The first consists of formulating hypotheses; the second consists of experimentally testing them. What differentiates science from other knowledge is the second episode: subjecting hypotheses to empirical testing by observing whether or not predictions derived from a hypothesis are the case in relevant observations and experiments. A hypothesis is scientific only if it is consistent with some but not other possible states of affairs not yet observed, so that it is subject to the possibility of falsification by reference to experience. Darwin occupies an exalted place in the history of Western thought, deservedly receiving credit for the theory of evolution. In The Origin of Species, he laid out the evidence demonstrating the evolution of organisms. More important yet is that he discovered natural selection, the process that accounts for the adaptations of organisms and their complexity and diversification. Natural selection and other causal processes of evolution are investigated by formulating and testing hypotheses. Darwin advanced hypotheses in multiple fields, including geology, plant morphology and physiology, psychology, and evolution, and subjected them to severe empirical tests.},

Despite the advances achieved by these technologies in the understanding of gene function at the genomic and proteomic level, there is still a big genotype-phenotype gap. Metabolic profiling has been used to analyze organisms that have already been characterized genetically. However, there is a small number of studies comparing the metabolic profile of different tissues of distinct accessions. Here, we report the detection of over 14,000 and 17,000 features in inflorescences and leaves, respectively, in two widely used Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. A predictive Random Forest Model was developed, which was able to reliably classify tissue type and accession of samples based on LC-MS profile. Thereby we demonstrate that the morphological differences among A. thaliana accessions are reflected also as distinct metabolic phenotypes within leaves and inflorescences.},

The method estimates the dissimilarity distance between screened MS/MS spectra and unannotated spectra from a partially redundant background library compiled from several control and blank runs. Filtering MS/MS queries enhanced the protein identification capacity when searches lacked spectrum to sequence matching specificity. In sequence-similarity searches it reduced by, on average, 30-fold the number of orphan hits, which were not explicitly related to background protein contaminants and required manual validation. Removing high quality background MS/MS spectra, while preserving in the data set the genuine spectra from target proteins, decreased the false positive rate of stringent database searches and improved the identification of low-abundance proteins.},

NMR experiments and structure calculation protocols developed for the investigation of peptides with distinct preferred conformations, as observed in constrained (cyclic or N-methylated) peptides, are also presented. Many of these approaches differ greatly from NMR experiments and structure calculation strategies designed for studying proteins, as demonstrated by the following:Heteronuclear multiple-bond correlations (HMBCs) play an important role in the assignment process and in determining preferred dihedral angles.Rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) rather than nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra are used for the calculation of distance restraints that are obtained with a higher precision than distance restraints in proteins.3J coupling constants can often be read from different kinds of multiplet splittings (e.g., from one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra or from correlation spectroscopy (COSY)-type multiplet patterns).Different types of ROESY experiments, methods for the determination of 3J coupling constants, as well as an overview of residual dipolar coupling-based peptide NMR studies and the alignment media used therein are described. The impact of peptide flexibility for conformational studies is discussed in the context of distance and dihedral restraints.

In this context, mass spectrometry (MS) has developed into a necessary tool to assess quality and safety of food and, more recently, to determine the presence and behavior of functional components such as these bioactive peptides. This review highlights the existing methods based on MS to identify, characterize, and quantify food-derived biologically active peptides, taking into account the different ionization sources used for the analysis of these high-value food components.

  abstract = {The study of pharmacologically active peptides is central to the understanding of disease and development of novel therapies. It would be advantageous to monitor the fate of bioactive peptides in biological fluids and tissues following their in vivo administration (exogenous administration) or the modulation of endogenous factors (e.g., peptide hormones) affected by the administration of a pharmacological agent. Measurement of administered compounds (small molecules) in plasma is a mature field. However, measurement of pharmacologically active peptides presents particular problems for quantitative mass spectrometry, including challenges from selectivity and sensitivity perspectives. Current approaches towards peptide quantification in biological fluids include immunoassays and mass spectrometric techniques. Immunoassays, although sensitive, lack the necessary selectivity for distinction between peptide and metabolites. Modified molecules induced by metabolic transformations (e.g., N- or C-terminal truncation of the peptide) might not be differentiated by the antibody used in the assay, leading to cross-reactivity. However, although it is generally accepted that mass spectrometry is an ideal technique for the quantification of trace levels of analytes in biological fluids, immunological techniques are still characterized by better limits of peptide detection. In this review article, novel mass spectrometric approaches and strategies on peptide quantification will be described. The current capabilities and prospects for advances in this critical area of research will be examined.},

Their mass spectrometric characterization is difficult due to the predominant occurrence of non-proteinogenic monomers and the complex fragmentation patterns observed. Even though several software tools for cyclic peptide tandem mass spectra annotation have been published, these tools are still unable to annotate a majority of the signals observed in experimentally obtained mass spectra. They are thus not suitable for extensive mass spectrometric characterization of these compounds. This lack of advanced and user-friendly software tools has motivated us to extend the fragmentation module of a freely available open-source software, mMass (http://www.mmass.org), to allow for cyclic peptide tandem mass spectra annotation and interpretation. The resulting software has been tested on several cyanobacterial and other naturally occurring peptides. It has been found to be superior to other currently available tools concerning both usability and annotation extensiveness. Thus it is highly useful for accelerating the structure confirmation and elucidation of cyclic as well as linear peptides and depsipeptides.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Mass spectrometry (MS) instruments and experimental protocols are rapidly advancing, but de novo peptide sequencing algorithms to analyze tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra are lagging behind. Although existing de novo sequencing tools perform well on certain types of spectra [e.g. Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) spectra of tryptic peptides], their performance often deteriorates on other types of spectra, such as Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD), Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) spectra or spectra of non-tryptic digests. Thus, rather than developing a new algorithm for each type of spectra, we develop a universal de novo sequencing algorithm called UniNovo that works well for all types of spectra or even for spectral pairs (e.g. CID/ETD spectral pairs). UniNovo uses an improved scoring function that captures the dependences between different ion types, where such dependencies are learned automatically using a modified offset frequency function., Results: The performance of UniNovo is compared with PepNovo+, PEAKS and pNovo using various types of spectra. The results show that the performance of UniNovo is superior to other tools for ETD spectra and superior or comparable with others for CID and HCD spectra. UniNovo also estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training dataset. We demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including CID, HCD, ETD, CID/ETD and HCD/ETD spectra of trypsin, LysC or AspN digested peptides)., Availability: UniNovo is implemented in JAVA and tested on Windows, Ubuntu and OS X machines.

due to the numerous possibilities for isomerization, both within the

mobility spectrometry (FAIMS), also known as differential ion mobility,
is able to separate isomeric O-linked glycopeptides that have identical
sequences but differing sites of glycosylation. Two glycopeptides
from the glycoprotein mucin 5AC, GT(GalNAc)TPSPVPTTSTTSAP and GTTPSPVPTTST(GalNAc)TSAP
(where GalNAc is O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine), were shown to coelute
following reversed-phase liquid chromatography. However, FAIMS analysis
of the glycopeptides revealed that the compensation voltage ranges
in which the peptides were transmitted differed. Thus, it is possible
at certain compensation voltages to completely separate the glycopeptides.
Separation of the glycopeptides was confirmed by unique reporter ions
produced by supplemental activation electron transfer dissociation
mass spectrometry. These fragments also enable localization of the
site of glycosylation. The results suggest that glycan position plays
a key role in determining gas-phase glycopeptide structure and have
implications for the application of FAIMS in glycoproteomics.},

  abstract = {The modification of Ser/Thr residues in proteins by addition of single O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) moieties play an important role in cell regulation. However, understanding the cellular mechanisms that regulate O-GlcNAc glycosylation has been challenging due to the difficulty in detection and quantification of this modification. Mass spectrometry-based multiplex quantitative approaches have been successfully employed to measure relative phosphorylation levels using collisionally induced dissociation (CID). However, labile modifications such as O-GlcNAc are lost prior to fragmentation of the peptide backbone in conventional CID, often preventing correct peptide identification, localization of the modified site, and as a result, relative quantification. Compared to CID, Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD) preserves labile post-translational modifications (PTMs), and allows direct mapping of peptide/protein modifications. This is the first report to assess the utility of combining multiplexed isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and ETD for relative quantification of labile PTMs. ETD analysis of both labeled and unlabeled peptides from bovine $\alpha$-crystallins pinpointed at least one O-GlcNAc containing modification site in each of the protein subunits, in addition to a multitude of other PTMs, including glycation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. Moreover, ETD of TMT6 labeled peptides produced four unique reporter ions that could be used for relative quantification. TMT reporter ion ratios measured by ETD had similar accuracy and precision as those obtained by conventional CID techniques. When applied to glycosylated or otherwise modified peptides, ETD was the only dissociation method which consistently provided confident sequence identification, PTM localization, and quantitative information, all in the same spectrum. This suggests that ETD-based workflows can be complementary to traditional CID approaches when used for simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of modified peptides.},

  abstract = {Collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem mass spectrometry (MS) does not allow the characterization of glycopeptides because of the fragmentation of their glycan structures and limited fragmentation of peptide backbones. Electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) tandem MS, on the other hand, offers an alternative approach allowing the fragmentation of only peptide backbones of glycopeptides. Characterization of glycopeptides using both CID and ETD is summarized in this unit. While CID provide information related to the composition of glycan moiety attached to a peptide backbone, ETD permits de novo sequencing of peptides, since it prompts only peptide backbone fragmentation while keeping posttranslational modifications intact. Radical anions transfer of electrons to peptide backbone which induces cleavage of the N-C$\alpha$ bond is observed in ETD. The glycan moiety is retained on the peptide backbone, largely unaffected by the ETD process. Accordingly, ETD allows not only the identification of the amino acid sequence of a glycopeptide, but also the unambiguous assignment of its glycosylation site. When data acquired from both fragmentation techniques are combined, it is possible to characterize comprehensively the entire glycopeptide. This is achieved using an instrument capable of alternating between CID and ETD experiments during an LC-MS/MS analysis. This unit discusses the different fragmentation of glycopeptides observed in CID and ETD. Tables of residue masses associated with oxonium ions observed in CID are provided to help in the interpretation of CID mass spectra. The utility of both CID and ETD for better characterization of glycopeptides are demonstrated for a model glycoprotein.},

To a large extent, however, previously reported identifications of these modifications were performed using peptide mass fingerprinting and/or tandem-MS data of proteins separated by gel electrophoresis. To date, it is uncertain whether NFK and KYN may represent sample handling artifacts or exclusively post-translational events. To address the problem of the origin of tryptophan oxidation, we characterized several antibodies by liquid chromatography \textendash{} tandem mass spectrometry, with and without the use of electrophoretic separation of heavy and light chains. Antibodies are not normally expected to undergo oxidative modifications, however, several Trp residues on both heavy and light chains were found extensively modified to both doubly oxidized Trp and KYN following SDS-PAGE separation and in-gel digestion. In contrast, those residues were observed as non-modified upon in-solution digestion. These results indicate that Trp oxidation may occur as an artifact in proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and their presence should be carefully interpreted, especially when gel electrophoretic separation methods are employed.},

The recent development of a novel mass spectrometer (Orbitrap) and new dissociation methods such as electron transfer dissociation have made possible exciting new areas of proteomic application. Although bottom-up proteomics (analysis of proteolytic peptide mixtures) remains the workhorse for proteomic analysis, middle- and top-down strategies (analysis of longer peptides and intact proteins, respectively) should allow more complete characterization of protein isoforms and post-translational modifications. Finally, stable isotope labeling strategies have transformed mass spectrometry from merely descriptive to a tool for measuring dynamic changes in protein expression, interaction and modification.},

  abstract = {Common bean is the most important grain legume in the human diet. Bean improvement efforts have been focused on classical breeding techniques because bean is recalcitrant to both somatic embryogenesis and in vitro regeneration. This study was undertaken to better understand the process of somatic embryogenesis in the common bean. We focused on the mechanisms by which somatic embryogenesis in plants is regulated and the interaction of these mechanisms with plant hormones. Specifically, we examined the role of the gene PvTRX1h, an ortholog of a major known histone lysine methyltransferase in plants, in somatic embryo generation. Given the problems with regeneration and transformation, we chose to develop and use regeneration-competent callus that could be successively transformed. Embryogenic calli of common bean were generated and transformed with the PvTRX1hRiA construction to down-regulate, by RNA interference, expression of the PvTRX1h gene. Plant hormone content was measured by mass spectrometry and gene expression was assessed by q-PCR. Detailed histological analysis was performed on selected transgenic embryogenic calli. It was determined that down-regulation of PvTRX1h gene was accompanied by altered concentrations of plant hormones in the calli. PvTRX1h regulated the expression of genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and embryogenic calli in which PvTRX1h was down-regulated were capable of differentiation into somatic embryos. Also, down-regulation of PvTRX1h showed increased transcript abundance of a gene coding for a second histone lysine methyltransferase, PvASHH2h. Accordingly, the PvTRX1h gene is involved in the synthesis of plant hormones in common bean callus. These results shed light on the crosstalk among histone methyltransferases and plant hormone signaling and on gene regulation during somatic embryo generation.},

A major challenge in interpreting the data is distinguishing metabolites that are causally associated with the phenotype of interest from those that are unrelated but altered in downstream pathways as an effect. To facilitate this distinction, here we describe new software called metaXCMS for performing second-order (``meta'') analysis of untargeted metabolomics data from multiple sample groups representing different models of the same phenotype. While the current version of XCMS was designed for the direct comparison of two sample groups, metaXCMS enables meta-analysis of an unlimited number of sample classes to facilitate prioritization of the data and increase the probability of identifying metabolites causally related to the phenotype of interest. metaXCMS is used to import XCMS results that are subsequently filtered, realigned, and ultimately compared to identify shared metabolites that are up- or down-regulated across all sample groups. We demonstrate the software's utility by identifying histamine as a metabolite that is commonly altered in three different models of pain. metaXCMS is freely available at http://metlin.scripps.edu/metaxcms/.},

The addition reaction caused by the free-radical species in the methanol\textendash{}water solution resulted in the formation of most radiolytic products.

An MS2T library of Arabidopsis metabolites was created from a set of MS/MS spectra acquired using the automatic data acquisition function of the mass spectrometer. By using this library, we obtained structural information for the detected peaks in the metabolic profile data without performing additional MS/MS analysis; this was achieved by searching for the corresponding MS2T accession in the library. In the case of metabolic profile data for Arabidopsis tissues containing more than 1000 peaks, approximately 50\% of the peaks were tagged by MS2Ts, and 90 peaks were identified or tentatively annotated with metabolite information by searching the metabolite databases and manually interpreting the MS2Ts. A comparison of metabolic profiles among the Arabidopsis tissues revealed that many unknown metabolites accumulated in a tissue-specific manner, some of which were deduced to be unusual Arabidopsis metabolites based on the MS2T data. Candidate genes responsible for these biosyntheses could be predicted by projecting the results to the transcriptome data. The method was also used for metabolic phenotyping of a subset of Ds transposon-inserted lines of Arabidopsis, resulting in clarification of the functions of reported genes involved in glycosylation of flavonoids. Thus, non-targeted metabolic profiling analysis using MS2T annotation methods could prove to be useful for investigating novel functions of secondary metabolites in plants.},

  abstract = {This article introduces a new interface for T-Coffee, a consistency-based multiple sequence alignment program. This interface provides an easy and intuitive access to the most popular functionality of the package. These include the default T-Coffee mode for protein and nucleic acid sequences, the M-Coffee mode that allows combining the output of any other aligners, and template-based modes of T-Coffee that deliver high accuracy alignments while using structural or homology derived templates. These three available template modes are Expresso for the alignment of protein with a known 3D-Structure, R-Coffee to align RNA sequences with conserved secondary structures and PSI-Coffee to accurately align distantly related sequences using homology extension. The new server benefits from recent improvements of the T-Coffee algorithm and can align up to 150 sequences as long as 10,000 residues and is available from both http://www.tcoffee.org and its main mirror http://tcoffee.crg.cat.},

While current metabolomics techniques enable high-throughput quantification of metabolites, these methods provide minimal information on the rates and connectivity of metabolic pathways. Here we present a new method, nontargeted tracer fate detection (NTFD), that expands upon the concept of metabolomics to solve the above problems. Through the combined use of stable isotope tracers and chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, our computational analysis enables the quantitative detection of all measurable metabolites derived from a specific labeled compound. Without a priori knowledge of a reaction network or compound library, NTFD provides information about relative flux magnitudes into each metabolite pool by determining the mass isotopomer distribution for all labeled compounds. This novel method adds a new dimension to the metabolomics tool box and provides a framework for global analysis of metabolic fluxes.},

Metabolomics aims at the comprehensive and quantitative analysis of wide arrays of metabolites in biological samples. These numerous analytes have very diverse physico-chemical properties and occur at different abundance levels. Consequently, comprehensive metabolomics investigations are primarily a challenge for analytical chemistry and specifically mass spectrometry has vast potential as a tool for this type of investigation. Metabolomics require special approaches for sample preparation, separation, and mass spectrometric analysis. Current examples of those approaches are described in this review. It primarily focuses on metabolic fingerprinting, a technique that analyzes all detectable analytes in a given sample with subsequent classification of samples and identification of differentially expressed metabolites, which define the sample classes. To perform this complex task, data analysis tools, metabolite libraries, and databases are required. Therefore, recent advances in metabolomics bioinformatics are also discussed. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 26:51\textendash{}78, 2007},

  abstract = {In the present work LC-MS/MS was applied to measure the concentrations of intermediates of glycolysis and TCA cycle during autonomous, cell-cycle synchronized oscillations in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This study complements previously reported oscillations in carbon dioxide production rate, intracellular concentrations of trehalose and various free amino acids, and extracellular acetate and pyruvate in the same culture. Of the glycolytic intermediates, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate show the most pronounced oscillatory behavior, the latter three compounds oscillating out of phase with the former. This agrees with previously observed metabolic control by phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Although individually not clearly oscillating, several intermediates of the TCA cycle, i.e., alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, exhibited increasing concentration during the cell cycle phase with high carbon flux through glycolysis and TCA cycle. The average mass action ratios of beta-phosphoglucomutase and fumarase agreed well with previously determined in vitro equilibrium constants. Minor differences resulted for phosphoglucose isomerase and enolase. Together with the observed close correlation of the pool sizes of the involved metabolites, this might indicate that, in vivo, these reactions are operating close to equilibrium, whereby care must be taken due to possible differences between in vivo and in vitro conditions. Combining the data with previously determined intracellular amino acid levels from the same culture, a few clear correlations between catabolism and anabolism could be identified: phosphoglycerate/serine and alpha-ketoglutarate/lysine exhibited correlated oscillatory behavior, albeit with different phase shifts. Oscillations in intracellular amino acids might therefore be, at least partly, following oscillations of their anabolic precursors.},

An embedded microcomputer has been developed for system control. Detection of organic gases diluted in the air has been demonstrated up to 6 ppm for toluene and 22 ppm for dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP).

Data-dependent tandem mass spectra were acquired during lane scans across the TLC plates. Peptides and the corresponding proteins were identified using a protein database search software. Two-dimensional distributions of identified peptides were mapped for each separated protein digest. Sequence coverages for cytochrome c and myoglobin were 81 and 74\%, respectively. These compared well with those determined using the more standard HPLC/ESI-MS/MS approach (89 and 84\%, respectively). Preliminary results show that use of more sensitive instrumentation has the potential for improved detection of peptides with low Rf values and improvement in sequence coverage. However, less multiple charging and more sodiation were seen in HPTLC/DESI-MS spectra relative to HPLC/ESI-MS spectra, which can affect peptide identification by MS/MS. Methods to increase multiple charging and reduce the extent of sodiation are currently under investigation. Published in 2008 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {As a scientist, you are a professional writer: your career is built on successful proposals and papers. Success isn't defined by getting papers into print, but by getting them into the reader's consciousness. Writing Science is built upon the idea that successful science writing tells a story. It uses that insight to discuss how to write more effectively. Integrating lessons from other genres of writing with those from the author's years of experience as author, reviewer, and editor, the book shows scientists and students how to present their research in a way that is clear and that will maximize reader comprehension.  The book takes an integrated approach, using the principles of story structure to discuss every aspect of successful science writing, from the overall structure of a paper or proposal to individual sections, paragraphs, sentences, and words. It begins by building core arguments, analyzing why some stories are engaging and memorable while others are quickly forgotten, and proceeds to the elements of story structure, showing how the structures scientists and researchers use in papers and proposals fit into classical models. The book targets the internal structure of a paper, explaining how to write clear and professional sections, paragraphs, and sentences in a way that is clear and compelling. The ideas within a paper should flow seamlessly, drawing readers along. The final section of the book deals with special challenges, such as how to discuss research limitations and how to write for the public.   Writing Science is a much-needed guide to succeeding in modern science. Its insights and strategies will equip science students, scientists, and professionals across a wide range of scientific and technical fields with the tools needed to communicate effectively.},

Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) is carried out by directing electrosprayed charged droplets and ions of solvent onto the surface to be analyzed. The impact of the charged particles on the surface produces gaseous ions of material originally present on the surface. The resulting mass spectra are similar to normal ESI mass spectra in that they show mainly singly or multiply charged molecular ions of the analytes. The DESI phenomenon was observed both in the case of conductive and insulator surfaces and for compounds ranging from nonpolar small molecules such as lycopene, the alkaloid coniceine, and small drugs, through polar compounds such as peptides and proteins. Changes in the solution that is sprayed can be used to selectively ionize particular compounds, including those in biological matrices. In vivo analysis is demonstrated.},

Ambient MS also allows label-free detection of compounds and gives unique insights into temporal changes and tissue architecture in two and three dimensions. Compounds studied range from natural products (e.g., neurotransmitters, metabolites, organic acids, polyamines, sugars, lipids, and peptides) to xenobiotics (e.g., pharmaceuticals), dyes, polymers, explosives, and toxins.
This critical review covers analytical trends in ambient MS. Our discussions primarily touch on the mechanisms of sampling and the bioanalytical implications for in situ and in vivo experiments.

  abstract = {We describe a new method (T-Coffee) for multiple sequence alignment that provides a dramatic improvement in accuracy with a modest sacrifice in speed as compared to the most commonly used alternatives. The method is broadly based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests.},

Molecular imaging by mass spectrometry is one such growth area. The development of a capability for 2D chemical imaging of surfaces is described, based on the combination of a desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) ion source with an automated surface stage capable of x, y translational motion. The lateral resolution of this new system is found to be less than 200 microns, using a test ink pattern. Chemical imaging of surfaces is demonstrated using model examples of organic and biological systems: (i) imaging of a 2D pattern written in different colored inks on photographic paper and (ii) imaging of thin coronal sections of rat brain tissue fixed onto a glass microscope slide. In both cases, full mass spectra are recorded as a function of x,y-position on the surface. In the chemical imaging example, the distributions of the two different inks on the paper surface were mapped by tracking the abundance of the intact organic cation which characterizes each particular ink dye. In the tissue imaging example, distributions of specific lipids in coronal sections of rat brain tissue were followed from the abundance distributions in 2D space of the deprotonated lipid molecules recorded in the negative ion mass spectra. These latter distributions reveal distinct anatomical features of the rat brain. The results of these studies demonstrate the feasibility of performing surface imaging studies using DESI and show that at this stage of its development it has a lateral spatial resolution of a few hundred microns.},

  abstract = {A complete cold chain freeze-fracture methodology has been developed to test the feasibility of using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) imaging for the molecular analysis of frozen hydrated biological samples. Because the technique only samples the first few monolayers of a sample, water on the surface of a sample can be a major source of interference. This problem can be minimized by placing a cold trap (fracture knife and housing at -196$^\circ$C) near the fractured sample that is held at a warmer temperature (-97 to -113$^\circ$C). This results in removal of surface water and prevents condensation on the surface. Although this approach is effective, it has been found mat sample warming needs to be carefully controlled due to the volatility of other matrix molecules and the morphological effects imparted onto the cell surface during drying. By utilizing the above handling technique, it has been possible to demonstrate for the first time that TOF-SIMS imaging technology can be used to obtain images of molecular species across a cell surface with a submicrometer ion probe beam. Images of small hydrocarbons and the deliberately added dopants DMSO and cocaine have been obtained with TOF-SIMS of the single-cell organism Paramecium.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has emerged as an important tool in the last decade and it is beginning to show potential to provide new information in many fields owing to its unique ability to acquire molecularly specific images and to provide multiplexed information, without the need for labeling or staining. In MSI, the chemical identity of molecules present on a surface is investigated as a function of spatial distribution. In addition to now standard methods involving MSI in vacuum, recently developed ambient ionization techniques allow MSI to be performed under atmospheric pressure on untreated samples outside the mass spectrometer. Here we review recent developments and applications of MSI emphasizing the ambient ionization techniques of desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI), probe electrospray ionization (PESI), desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization (DAPPI), femtosecond laser desorption ionization (fs-LDI), laser electrospray mass spectrometry (LEMS), infrared laser ablation metastable-induced chemical ionization (IR-LAMICI), liquid microjunction surface sampling probe mass spectrometry (LMJ-SSP MS), nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI), and plasma sources such as the low temperature plasma (LTP) probe and laser ablation coupled to flowing atmospheric-pressure afterglow (LA-FAPA). Included are discussions of some of the features of ambient MSI for example the ability to implement chemical reactions with the goal of providing high abundance ions characteristic of specific compounds of interest and the use of tandem mass spectrometry to either map the distribution of targeted molecules with high specificity or to provide additional MS information on the structural identification of compounds. We also describe the role of bioinformatics in acquiring and interpreting the chemical and spatial information obtained through MSI, especially in biological applications for tissue diagnostic purposes. Finally, we discuss the challenges in ambient MSI and include perspectives on the future of the field. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 32:218\textendash{}243, 2013},

In this work, the low temperature plasma probe is used in the direct and rapid mass spectrometric analysis of aqueous phase samples including biofluids (saliva, urine, and hair extract). A detailed trace qualitative examination of 14 drugs of abuse has been performed. The relative standard deviation on average was approximately 16\% for the LTP analysis of the drugs of abuse standards. Eleven of the fourteen drugs of abuse were detected in the low ng mL(-1) (3 pg absolute detection) to the mid microg mL(-1) (approximately 30 ng absolute detection) concentration range. One drug, cannabidiol, could not be detected until supplemental heating of the substrate was incorporated into the experimental protocol. The addition of supplemental heating improved the detection limits by at least an order of magnitude to approximately 0.5 ng mL(-1) to 0.5 microg mL(-1) (1.5 pg-1.5 ng absolute) for twelve of the fourteen drugs of abuse, so extending the linear dynamic range which for most analytes was four orders of magnitude. Quantitative capabilities were evaluated using the particular example of benzoylecgonine in urine by employing a deuterated internal standard. Matrix effects observed during the analysis of the drugs in complex biological fluids are also discussed. In addition, low temperature plasma ionization was applied to the examination of real (not spiked) biological samples and these results were confirmed using standard LC/MS methodology. The main advantages observed for this ambient desorption/ionization technique include the capabilities for direct analysis of liquid surfaces for in situ detection and the remarkable sensitivity in the examination of the drugs of abuse investigated here. The disadvantages of the method include the modest quantitative accuracy making LTP most useful as a rapid but semi-quantitative screening method.},

  abstract = {Detection of explosives is important for public safety. A recently developed low-temperature plasma (LTP) probe for desorption and ionization of samples in the ambient environment ( Anal. Chem. 2008, 80, 9097 ) is applied in a comprehensive evaluation of analytical performance for rapid detection of 13 explosives and explosives-related compounds. The selected chemicals [pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclo-1,3,5-trimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), tetryl, cyclo-1,3,5,7-tetramethylenetetranitrate (HMX), hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene, 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene, 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2,6-dinitrotoluene, and 4-nitrotoluene) were tested at levels in the range 1 pg?10 ng. Most showed remarkable sensitivity in the negative-ion mode, yielding limits of detection in the low picogram range, particularly when analyzed from a glass substrate heated to 120 $^\circ$C. Ions typically formed from these molecules (M) by LTP include [M + NO2]?, [M]?, and [M ? NO2]?. The LTP-mass spectrometry methodology displayed a linear signal response over three orders of magnitude of analyte amount for the studied explosives. In addition, the effects of synthetic matrices and different types of surfaces were evaluated. The data obtained demonstrate that LTP-MS allows detection of ultratrace amounts of explosives and confirmation of their identity. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was used to confirm the presence of selected explosives at low levels; for example, TNT was confirmed at absolute levels as low as 0.6 pg. Linearity and intra- and interday precision were also evaluated, yielding results that demonstrate the potential usefulness and ruggedness of LTP-MS for the detection of explosives of different classes. The use of ion/molecule reactions to form adducts with particular explosives such as RDX and HMX was shown to enhance the selectivity and specificity. This was accomplished by merging the discharge gas with an appropriate reagent headspace vapor (e.g., from a 0.2\% trifluoracetic acid solution).},

Thermally assisted desorption and ionization of the analyte was achieved with the plasma probe. The small size, low power consumption and capability for direct sampling without pretreatment makes plasma ionization an appropriate ionization method for use with a handheld mass spectrometer. The standard discontinuous atmospheric pressure interface used to connect atmospheric pressure ion sources to mass spectrometers (Gao et al., Anal. Chem., 2008, 80, 4026-4032) was modified by using supplementary pumping to increase the ion transfer efficiency. Whole milk, fish, milk powder and other complex matrices spiked with melamine were placed on glass slides close to the vacuum inlet and analyzed without sample pretreatment. Quantitation in complex matrices was achieved using MS/MS of protonated melamine m/z 127 to yield the characteristic fragment ion of m/z 85. Analysis rates of two samples per minute, levels of melamine as low as 250 ng/mL in whole milk (below the regulatory level in the US of 1 ppm (1 microg/mL) or the European level of 2.5 ppm (microg/mL)), a linear dynamic range of 0.5-50 microg/mL and a relative standard deviation of ca. 7.6-16.2\% were achieved. The importance of melamine to public health and the prior lack of a rapid, sensitive and yet highly specific field analysis method add to the relevance of this study.},

  abstract = {A new low-temperature plasma (LTP), based on dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), has been developed as an alternative ionization source for ambient mass spectrometry. For organic samples, the source is able to produce two different fragmentation patterns which are selectable by an electrical switch. The two source modes are different only in the second electrodes: in configuration (A), bar-plate and in configuration (B), coaxial bar\textendash{}cylinder shapes are used. A disposable graphite probe is used as the first electrode, the same in both configurations, and a copper foil is used as the second electrode. The ionization source is applicable to gas and liquid samples, without any change being necessary in its design. Under optimal conditions, to take ethylbenzene as an example, a detection limit of less than 25\,ng was obtained and a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 13.36\% has been demonstrated for 50\,ng of ethylbenzene (n\,=\,11). We have found several interesting differences in the mass spectra of the tested volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the two modes, which might be applicable in identification studies. We have investigated the effect of variation of the first electrode material and the second electrode length in mode B. Moreover, in this design the graphite electrode is capable of acting as a sample adsorbent, which is a new sampling method for LTP mass spectrometry (MS). This capability was investigated by adsorption of the selected VOCs onto the surface of the graphite electrode in a headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) system, and direct desorption and ionization of the samples by LTPMS.

Besides, ambient air does not take part in the ionization of the sample vapor because ionization takes place inside the DBD ion source. Thus, this method is totally free from contaminants in ambient air. It was found that this ion source is capable of soft, high-sensitivity, and reproducible ionization.

  abstract = {Helium Plasma Ionization (HePI) generates gaseous negative ions upon exposure of vapors emanating from organic nitro compounds. A simple adaptation converts any electrospray ionization source to a HePI source by passing helium through the sample delivery metal capillary held at a negative potential. Compared with the demands of other He-requiring ambient pressure ionization sources, the consumption of helium by the HePI source is minimal (20-30\,ml/min). Quantification experiments conducted by exposing solid deposits to a HePI source revealed that 1\,ng of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) on a filter paper (about 0.01\,ng/mm(2)) could be detected by this method. When vapor emanating from a 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) sample was subjected to helium plasma ionization mass spectrometry (HePI-MS), a peak was observed at m/z 268 for (RDX\ding{108}NO(2))(-). This facile formation of NO(2)(-) adducts was noted without the need of any extra additives as dopants. Quantitative evaluations showed RDX detection by HePI-MS to be linear over at least three orders of magnitude. TNT samples placed even 5\,m away from the source were detected when the sample headspace vapor was swept by a stream of argon or nitrogen and delivered to the helium plasma ion source via a metal tube. Among the tubing materials investigated, stainless steel showed the best performance for sample delivery. A system with a copper tube, and air as the carrier gas, for example, failed to deliver any detectable amount of TNT to the source. In fact, passing over hot copper appears to be a practical way of removing TNT or other nitroaromatics from ambient air.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: This paper reports the development of arrays of capillary-based low-temperature plasma (LTP) probes for direct sample analysis. These probe arrays allow a higher surface area to be analyzed, increasing the throughput in large sample analysis. Validation of these arrays was performed on illicit, cathinone-based drugs marketed as 'bath salts'.
METHODS: LTP arrays consisting of 1, 7, and 19 probes were constructed with quartz capillaries and held together with silver epoxy resin adhesive. Three drugs, mephedrone, methylone and methylenedioxypyrovalerone, were analyzed with each plasma ion source and an ion trap mass spectrometer in full MS and in MS/MS positive ion mode. Chemical and thermal footprints were determined for each source. A reactive probe design was used to inject trifluoroacetic anhydride directly into the plasma stream for on-line derivatization.
RESULTS: Small LTP probes and bundled arrays provide low picogram level limits of detection for mephedrone, methylone and methylenedioxypyrovalerone. Bundling the probes together in larger arrays increases the surface area analyzed by a factor of ten, while maintaining surface temperatures below 40 $^\circ$C. Selectivity towards mephedrone and methylone was increased using trifluoracetylation under ambient ionization conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-temperature plasma ionization sources allow rapid detection of illicit 'bath salt' drugs in low amounts. The sources have a larger sampling area that allows faster detection of each analyte, and selectivity towards the selected drug is enhanced by adding reagents directly into the plasma stream.},

  doi = {10.1002/rcm.6518},
  abstract = {RATIONALE: The analysis of crude oil is a challenging task due to sample complexity. In mass spectrometry, several ionization techniques can be used to perform this task. Herein, we report the use of an atmospheric pressure low-temperature plasma (LTP) probe to desorb and ionize compounds of petroleum crude oil from different sources and residual fuel oil standard reference materials (SRMs). LTP is used to perform rapid screening of low molecular weight and relatively volatile components enabling characterization and differentiation of crude oil samples relying solely on mass spectrometric data.
METHODS: Crude oil samples were analyzed without sample preparation or dilution directly from sampling surfaces of different materials such as polytetrafluorethylene, glass and polyethylene. Analyses were performed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) with high mass accuracy and high resolving power of 400,000 at m/z 400 to estimate the elemental composition of the ions produced by LTP. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on the LTP data for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: LTP was found to generate positive ions of lower mass compounds of low to moderate polarity. Three-dimensional PCA plots efficiently differentiated between SRMs and Azerbaijan crude oil samples. Standards of alkanes, nitrogen heterocycles, sulfur heterocycles, hydrocarbon polycyclic aromatics and saturated acids were investigated for their behavior in LTP ionization. Alkanes were found to form oxidized products to some extent. The LTP probe worked particularly well in the characterization of sulfur compounds.
CONCLUSIONS: LTP ionization of crude oils was found to advantageously complement analysis by electrospray ionization. The LTP probe in combination with miniaturized mass spectrometers has the potential to provide direct composition analysis and source identification of crude oil contaminations in the future.},

  abstract = {Analysis and detection of micronutrients is important for the reduction of the global burden of malnutrition-related disease. A relatively new technique, plasma pencil atmospheric mass spectrometry (PPAMS) was applied in a comprehensive evaluation for rapid, simultaneous detection of the key micronutrients zinc, iron, folate, vitamin A, and iodine. PPAMS was performed through the coupling of a low-temperature plasma pencil to an atmospheric mass spectrometer. The effectiveness of the PPAMS system was demonstrated through the generation of characteristic mass spectra and tandem mass spectra on neat micronutrient powders suspended on double-sided tape. The analytical performance and ability to qualitatively separate out the nutrients from a complex biological solution and each other was then assessed through the application of PPAMS on a sample matrix of micronutrients in porcine plasma in which nutrient concentration is varied from high blood level concentrations (HBLCs) to low blood level concentrations (LBLCs). A multivariate analysis method, principal component analysis (PCA), was then used to qualitatively separate the fragments obtained by nutrient type. The resulting plots of PCA scores of the positive-ion spectra from each mixed sample showed excellent separation of HBLCs and LBLCs of single nutrients at the 95\% confidence level (Wagner et al. Langmuir 2001, 17, 4649-4660). The associated plots of PCA loadings showed that key loadings could be attributed to the expected micronutrient fragments. The PPAMS technique was successfully demonstrated and compared with traditional MS techniques: time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Separation of the nutrients at concentrations relevant for human blood-based nutrient detection was possible by both ESI-MS and PPAMS. However, only PPAMS could detect the nutrients at physiological concentrations from porcine plasma. ToF-SIMS could detect the nutrients from plasma solution but required 5 to 1000-times higher concentrations of folate, vitamin A, and iodine to achieve adequate separation of the micronutrients by PCA.},

This paper provides an analysis of the root causes of workflow decay based on an empirical study of a collection of Taverna workflows from the myExperiment repository. Although our analysis was based on a specific type of workflow, the outcomes and methodology should be applicable to workflows from other systems, at least those whose executions also rely largely on accessing third-party resources. Based on our understanding about decay we recommend a minimal set of auxiliary resources to be preserved together with the workflows as an aggregation object and provide a software tool for end-users to create such aggregations and to assess their completeness.},

Without sample preparation or pretreatment, the active ingredients of 11 types of commercial pharmaceuticals, including hormones, antipyretic analgesics, cardiovascular, digestant, neuro-psychotherapeutic, diuretic, antithyroid, sulfa anti-inflammatory, antiparastic, sedative-hypnotics, and antibacterial, were directly desorbed/ionized and detected by a linear ion trap mass spectrometry (MS). The structures of these ingredients were elucidated by tandem MS. The analysis of 18 methyltestosterone tablets could be accomplished within 1.9 min, which allows fast detection with a speed of approximate 600 samples within 1 h.

This new ionization source enhances the potential of IMS as a portable analytical tool and allows direct analysis of various chemical compounds without having to evaporate the analyte or seek a solvent or reagent whatsoever. The effects of parameters such as the flow rate of the discharge gas, plasma voltage, and positioning of the LTP on the IMS signal were investigated. The positive reactant ions generated by the LTP ionization source were similar to those created in a corona discharge ionization source, where the proton clusters ((H2O)nH+) are the most abundant reactant ion, and in the negative mode, in addition to a saturated electron peak, several negative reactant ions (e.g., NOx?) were observed too. These reactant ions subsequently ionized the gaseous samples directly and liquids or solids after evaporation by plasma desorption. The ion mobility spectra of a few selected compounds, including explosives, drugs, and amines, were obtained to evaluate the new ionization source in positive and negative modes, and the reduced mobility values (K0) of the originated ions were calculated. Furthermore, the method has also been applied to obtain the figures of merit for acetaminophen as a test compound. The results obtained are promising enough to ensure the use of LTP as a desorption/ionization source in IMS for analytical applications.},

Stable nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium plasma was generated in the quartz discharge tube when a microwave at a frequency of 2450 MHz was coupled to the microwave cavity. Analytes deposited on the surface of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) or quartz slide after hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching were desorbed and ionized by the plasma. The performance of the MIPDI technique was validated by the analysis of a variety of chemical substances, polymer compounds, and pharmaceutical drugs using argon or helium as the discharge gas. Protonated [M + H](+) or deprotonated [M - H](-) ions were observed in the positive or negative mode. MIPDI was also used for the analysis of compounds in a complex matrix without any sample preparation. MIPDI was also capable of analyzing liquid samples. The signal-to-noise ratio was 463 in the analysis of 9.2 ng of phenylalanine, and the limit of detection was 60 pg for phenylalanine. MIPDI could desorb and ionize analytes with a molecular weight of up to 1200, which was demonstrated by the analysis of polyethylene glycol 800 (PEG800). MIPDI has advantages of simple instrumentation, relatively high temperature, stability, and reproducibility.},

MyExperiment provides access to a large number of scientific workflows. However, scientists find it difficult to reuse or re-purpose these workflows for mainly two reasons: workflows suffer from decay over time and lack sufficient metadata to understand their purpose. We argue that good workflow design is a prerequisite for repairing a workflow, or redesigning an equivalent workflow pattern with new components. We present a set of best practices for workflow design and the semantic tooling that is being developed in the Workflow4Ever (Wf4Ever) project to support these best practices.},

It is well known that those plasmas generated by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) produce significant amount of metastable species and electrons with mean energies greater than several electronvolt, but minimal fragmentation was observed in our work. Protonated ions are the dominant product for the VOCs detected after the ionization process. Further work has been conducted to confirm the detection feature of this source.

This platform features two attractive characteristics: high sensitivity for the explosives with low volatility, and rapid analysis speed for the explosives on large surface areas. With non-contact heating by the halogen lamp, the signal intensities for the explosives with relatively high volatility were improved by over an order of magnitude, compared to those obtained at room temperature; and even more, the explosives with low volatility, which could hardly be detected at room temperature, were able to be readily identified. The limits of detection (LODs) of the selected explosives were all at the picogram level (e.g., 10 pg and 20 pg for TNT and RDX, respectively) with a heating time of 3 s. Using manual surface swabbing, the analysis of explosives on a large surface area (7.5 cm \texttimes{} 2.5 cm) was accomplished within 10 s, and an acceptable sensitivity could be acquired; additionally, inorganic explosives (black powder and firecracker) were successfully detected. Without any sample pretreatment, the platform was used to analyze the wastewater from an explosives factory, confirming the existence of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT), and the concentration of TNT was determined to be 5 ng~mL(-1).

However, thermal decomposition products in the battery reduce its lifetime, and decomposition processes are still not understood. In this study, a rapid method for in situ analysis and reaction monitoring in LIB electrolytes is presented based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) with low-temperature plasma probe (LTP) ambient desorption/ionization for the first time. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the capabilities of ambient mass spectrometry in battery research. LTP-HR-MS is ideally suited for qualitative analysis in the ambient environment because it allows direct sample analysis independent of the sample size, geometry, and structure. Further, it is environmental friendly because it eliminates the need of organic solvents that are typically used in separation techniques coupled to mass spectrometry. Accurate mass measurements were used to identify the time-/condition-dependent formation of electrolyte decomposition compounds. A LIB model electrolyte containing ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate was analyzed before and after controlled thermal stress and over the course of several weeks. Major decomposition products identified include difluorophosphoric acid, monofluorophosphoric acid methyl ester, monofluorophosphoric acid dimethyl ester, and hexafluorophosphate. Solvents (i.e., dimethyl carbonate) were partly consumed via an esterification pathway. LTP-HR-MS is considered to be an attractive method for fundamental LIB studies.},

  doi = {10.1002/rcm.6546},
  abstract = {RATIONALE: We developed a novel highly sensitive soft ionization method: a low-pressure dielectric barrier discharge ionization (LP-DBDI) source. In this configuration, samples pass through the inside of a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). Since samples pass through a DBD and its plasma jet, high ionization efficiency is expected. Furthermore, high transmission efficiency from the ion source to the mass spectrometer is also expected since the ion source is placed in a vacuum.
METHODS: Mass spectrometric detection was carried out in positive ion mode using an ion trap mass spectrometer. The LP-DBDI source or a conventional atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source was attached to the mass spectrometer. Samples were vaporized and sent to ion sources with air flowing at a constant flow rate of 1.5 L/min. The LP-DBDI source was compared with a conventional APCI source.
RESULTS: Mass spectra of methyl salicylate, 2-undecanone and methamphetamine were acquired using the LP-DBDI source. Protonated molecules were mainly observed in the mass spectra. The sensitivities for methyl salicylate and 2-undecanone obtained using the LP-DBDI source were 44 times and 39 times higher, respectively, than those obtained using an APCI source.
CONCLUSIONS: LP-DBDI is a soft ionization method characterized by only minor fragmentation, similar to APCI. The sensitivity of the LP-DBDI source was found to be about 40 times higher than that of the conventional APCI source.},

The low-pressure dielectric barrier discharge ionization (LP-DBDI) source made it possible to increase the conductance between the source and the mass analyzer, compared with ambient ionization sources, enhancing the efficiency of the ion transfer from the ionization source to the mass analyzer. We have also developed a vacuumed headspace method efficiently transporting the sample vapor to the ionization source.

These multilayer films have been prepared on quartz plates through the alternate assembling of oppositely charged 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) capped Au particles and thioglycolic acid (TGA) capped Ag particles. An LTP probe was used for direct desorption and ionization of chemical components on the films. Without the complicated sample preparation, the structure information of 4-ATP and TGA on films was studied by LTP-MS. Characteristic ions of 4-ATP (M) and TGA (F), including [M](+\textbullet), [M-NH(2)](+), [M-HCN-H](+), and [F\,+\,H](+), [F-H](+), [F-OH](+), [F-COOH](+) were recorded by LTP-MS on the films. However, [M-CS-H](+) and [F-SH](+) could not be observed on the film, which were detected in the neat sample. In addition, the semi-quantitative analysis of chemical components on monolayer film was carried out, and the amounts of 4-ATP and TGA on monolayer surface were 45 ng/mm(2) and 54 ng/mm(2), respectively. This resulted the ionization efficiencies of 72\% for 4-ATP and 54\% for TGA. In order to evaluate the reliability of present LTP-MS, the correlations between this approach and some traditional methods, such as UV-vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were studied, which resulted the correlation coefficients of higher than 0.9776. The results indicated that this technique can be used for analyzing the films without any pretreatment, which possesses great potential in the studies of self-assembly multilayer films.},

  abstract = {MassMatrix is a program that matches tandem mass spectra with theoretical peptide sequences derived from a protein database. The program uses a mass accuracy sensitive probabilistic score model to rank peptide matches. The MS/MS search software was evaluated by use of a high mass accuracy dataset and its results compared with those from MASCOT, SEQUEST, X!Tandem, and OMSSA. For the high mass accuracy data, MassMatrix provided better sensitivity than MASCOT, SEQUEST, X!Tandem, and OMSSA for a given specificity and the percentage of false positives was 2\%. More importantly all manually validated true positives corresponded to a unique peptide/spectrum match. The presence of decoy sequence and additional variable PTMs did not significantly affect the results from the high mass accuracy search. MassMatrix performs well when compared with MASCOT, SEQUEST, X!Tandem, and OMSSA with regard to search time. MassMatrix was also run on a distributed memory clusters and achieved search speeds of $\sim$100\,000 spectra per hour when searching against a complete human database with eight variable modifications. The algorithm is available for public searches at http://www.massmatrix.net.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in various `omics' technologies enable quantitative monitoring of the abundance of various biological molecules in a high-throughput manner, and thus allow determination of their variation between different biological states on a genomic scale. Several popular `omics' platforms that have been used in microbial systems biology include transcriptomics, which measures mRNA transcript levels; proteomics, which quantifies protein abundance; metabolomics, which determines abundance of small cellular metabolites; interactomics, which resolves the whole set of molecular interactions in cells; and fluxomics, which establishes dynamic changes of molecules within a cell over time. However, no single `omics' analysis can fully unravel the complexities of fundamental microbial biology. Therefore, integration of multiple layers of information, the multi-`omics' approach, is required to acquire a precise picture of living micro-organisms. In spite of this being a challenging task, some attempts have been made recently to integrate heterogeneous `omics' datasets in various microbial systems and the results have demonstrated that the multi-`omics' approach is a powerful tool for understanding the functional principles and dynamics of total cellular systems. This article reviews some basic concepts of various experimental `omics' approaches, recent application of the integrated `omics' for exploring metabolic and regulatory mechanisms in microbes, and advances in computational and statistical methodologies associated with integrated `omics' analyses. Online databases and bioinformatic infrastructure available for integrated `omics' analyses are also briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Missing values in mass spectrometry metabolomic datasets occur widely and can originate from a number of sources, including for both technical and biological reasons. Currently, little is known about these data, i.e. about their distributions across datasets, the need (or not) to consider them in the data processing pipeline, and most importantly, the optimal way of assigning them values prior to univariate or multivariate data analysis. Here, we address all of these issues using direct infusion Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry data. We have shown that missing data are widespread, accounting for ca. 20\% of data and affecting up to 80\% of all variables, and that they do not occur randomly but rather as a function of signal intensity and mass-to-charge ratio. We have demonstrated that missing data estimation algorithms have a major effect on the outcome of data analysis when comparing the differences between biological sample groups, including by t test, ANOVA and principal component analysis. Furthermore, results varied significantly across the eight algorithms that we assessed for their ability to impute known, but labelled as missing, entries. Based on all of our findings we identified the k-nearest neighbour imputation method (KNN) as the optimal missing value estimation approach for our direct infusion mass spectrometry datasets. However, we believe the wider significance of this study is that it highlights the importance of missing metabolite levels in the data processing pipeline and offers an approach to identify optimal ways of treating missing data in metabolomics experiments.},

In parallel to the terms `transcriptome' and `proteome', the set of metabolites synthesized by a biological system constitute its `metabolome'. Yet, unlike other functional genomics approaches, the unbiased simultaneous identification and quantification of plant metabolomes has been largely neglected. Until recently, most analyses were restricted to profiling selected classes of compounds, or to fingerprinting metabolic changes without sufficient analytical resolution to determine metabolite levels and identities individually. As a prerequisite for metabolomic analysis, careful consideration of the methods employed for tissue extraction, sample preparation, data acquisition, and data mining must be taken. In this review, the differences among metabolite target analysis, metabolite profiling, and metabolic fingerprinting are clarified, and terms are defined. Current approaches are examined, and potential applications are summarized with a special emphasis on data mining and mathematical modelling of metabolism.},

However, a variety of other ion sources are either currently in use to evaluate natural products or show significant future promise. This review discusses these various ion sources in the context of other articles in this special issue, but is also applicable to other fields of analysis, including materials science. Ion sources are grouped based on the current understanding of their predominant ion formation mechanisms. This broad overview groups ion sources into the following categories: electron ionization and single photon ionization; chemical ionization-like and plasma-based; electrospray ionization; and, laser desorption-based. Laser desorption-based methods are emphasized with specific examples given for laser desorption postionization sources and their use in the analysis of intact microbial biofilms. Brief consideration is given to the choice of ion source for various sample types and analyses, including MS imaging.},

In particular, label-free quantification based on LC-MS is easily amenable to large-scale studies and thus well suited to clinical metabolomics. Large-scale studies, however, require automated processing of the large and complex LC-MS datasets.
We present a novel algorithm for the detection of mass traces and their aggregation into features (i.e. all signals caused by the same analyte species) that is computationally efficient and sensitive and that leads to reproducible quantification results. The algorithm is based on a sensitive detection of mass traces, which are then assembled into features based on mass-to-charge spacing, co-elution information, and a support vector machine\textendash{}based classifier able to identify potential metabolite isotope patterns. The algorithm is not limited to metabolites but is applicable to a wide range of small molecules (e.g. lipidomics, peptidomics), as well as to other separation technologies.
We assessed the algorithm's robustness with regard to varying noise levels on synthetic data and then validated the approach on experimental data investigating human plasma samples. We obtained excellent results in a fully automated data-processing pipeline with respect to both accuracy and reproducibility. Relative to state-of-the art algorithms, ours demonstrated increased precision and recall of the method. The algorithm is available as part of the open-source software package OpenMS and runs on all major operating systems.},

  abstract = {This tutorial presents the most common ion activation techniques employed in tandem mass spectrometry. In-source fragmentation and metastable ion decompositions, as well as the general theory of unimolecular dissociations of ions, are initially discussed. This is followed by tandem mass spectrometry, which implies that the activation of ions is distinct from the ionization step, and that the precursor and product ions are both characterized independently by their mass/charge ratios. In collision-induced dissociation (CID), activation of the selected ions occurs by collision(s) with neutral gas molecules in a collision cell. This experiment can be done at high (keV) collision energies, using tandem sector and time-of-flight instruments, or at low (eV range) energies, in tandem quadrupole and ion trapping instruments. It can be performed using either single or multiple collisions with a selected gas and each of these factors influences the distribution of internal energy that the activated ion will possess. While CID remains the most common ion activation technique employed in analytical laboratories today, several new methods have become increasingly useful for specific applications. More recent techniques are examined and their differences, advantages and disadvantages are described in comparison with CID. Collisional activation upon impact of precursor ions on solid surfaces, surface-induced dissociation (SID), is gaining importance as an alternative to gas targets and has been implemented in several different types of mass spectrometers. Furthermore, unique fragmentation mechanisms of multiply-charged species can be studied by electron-capture dissociation (ECD). The ECD technique has been recognized as an efficient means to study non-covalent interactions and to gain sequence information in proteomics applications. Trapping instruments, such as quadrupole ion traps and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance instruments, are particularly useful for the photoactivation of ions, specifically for fragmentation of precursor ions by infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD). IRMPD is a non-selective activation method and usually yields rich fragmentation spectra. Lastly, blackbody infrared radiative dissociation is presented with a focus on determining activation energies and other important parameters for the characterization of fragmentation pathways. The individual methods are presented so as to facilitate the understanding of each mechanism of activation and their particular advantages and representative applications.

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry has recently undergone a second contemporary revolution with the introduction of a new group of desorption/ionization (DI) techniques known collectively as ambient mass spectrometry. Performed in an open atmosphere directly on samples in their natural environments or matrices, or by using auxiliary surfaces, ambient mass spectrometry (MS) has greatly simplified and increased the speed of MS analysis. Since its debut in 2004 there has been explosive growth in the applications and variants of ambient MS, and a very comprehensive set of techniques based on different desorption and ionization mechanisms is now available. Most types of molecules with a large range of masses and polarities can be ionized with great ease and simplicity with the outstanding combination of the speed, selectivity, and sensitivity of MS detection. This review describes and compares the basis of ionization and the concepts of the most promising ambient MS techniques known to date and illustrates, via typical analytical and bioanalytical applications, how ambient MS is helping to bring MS analysis deeper than ever into the ``real world'' open atmosphere environment\textemdash{}to wherever MS is needed.

The macroion current can be detected by a Faraday cage after the light ions have been repelled from the beam by negative voltages on a repeller grid. Theoretical repeller voltages which best agree with the observed are those calculated by assuming a macroion velocity within 2\% of the estimated supersonic beam velocity of 743 m sec-1. Polystyrene macroions of 51 000 weight-average amu tend to form dimers and trimers in the beam while larger polystyrene macroions of 411 000 weight-average amu appear mostly to be multiply charged single species. The results demonstrate that definite mass/charge states can be formed by the electrospray technique, that a considerable monochromatization of macroion velocities in the beam takes place, and that the macroions become highly concentrated relative to low-molecular-weight solvent and nitrogen ions during the transit time in the supersonic beam.},

  abstract = {This review article will give an up-to-date and exhaustive overview on the efficient use of electron ionization (EI) to couple liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC\textendash{}MS) with an innovative interface called Direct-EI. EI is based on the gas-phase ionization of the analytes, and it is suitable for many applications in a wide range of LC-amenable compounds. In addition, thanks to its operating principles, it prevents unwelcome matrix effects (ME). In fact, although atmospheric pressure ionization (API) methodologies have boosted the use of LC\textendash{}MS, the related analytical methods are sometime affected by inaccurate quantitative results, due to unavoidable and unpredictable ME. In addition, API's soft ionization spectra always demand for costly and complex tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) instruments, which are essential to acquire an ``information-rich'' spectrum and to obtain accurate quantitative information. In EI a one-stage analyzer is sufficient for a qualitative investigation and MS/MS detection is only used to improve sensitivity and to cut chemical noise. The technology illustrated here provides a robust and straightforward access to classical, well-characterized EI data for a variety of LC applications, and readily interpretable spectra for a wide range of areas of research. The Direct-EI interface can represent the basis for a forthcoming universal LC\textendash{}MS detector for small molecules. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:1242\textendash{}1255, 2011},

  abstract = {Two relatively new ambient ionization sources, direct analysis in real time (DART) and the flowing atmospheric-pressure afterglow (FAPA), use direct current, atmospheric-pressure discharges to produce reagent ions for the direct ionization of a sample. Although at a first glance these two sources appear similar, a fundamental study reveals otherwise. Specifically, DART was found to operate with a corona-to-glow transition (C-G) discharge whereas the FAPA was found to operate with a glow-to-arc transition (G-A) discharge. The characteristics of both discharges were evaluated on the basis of four factors: reagent-ion production, response to a model analyte (ferrocene), infrared (IR) thermography of the gas used for desorption and ionization, and spatial emission characteristics. The G-A discharge produced a greater abundance and a wider variety of reagent ions than the C-G discharge. In addition, the discharges yielded different adducts and signal strengths for ferrocene. It was also found that the gas exiting the discharge chamber reached a maximum of 235 $^\circ$C and 55 $^\circ$C for the G-A and C-G discharges, respectively. Finally, spatially resolved emission maps of both discharges showed clear differences for N2+ and O(I). These findings demonstrate that the discharges used by FAPA and DART are fundamentally different and should have different optimal applications for ambient desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (ADI-MS).},

General background levels are low and a wide range of elements may be determined with detection limits below 1 ng ml\textendash{}1.Spectra are very simple with few molecular analyte ions and only singly and doubly charged species are found. Mass resolution is adequate to avoid peak overlap and isotope ratio determinations may readily be made with precision below 0.5\%, with integration times of about 5 min.The operating characteristics and performance of the system are described and illustrated and the future development potential is discussed.},

  abstract = {A new ion source has been developed for rapid, noncontact analysis of materials at ambient pressure and at ground potential. The new source, termed DART (for "Direct Analysis in Real Time"), is based on the reactions of electronic or vibronic excited-state species with reagent molecules and polar or nonpolar analytes. DART has been installed on a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) that provides improved selectivity and accurate elemental composition assignment through exact mass measurements. Although DART has been applied to the analysis of gases, liquids, and solids, a unique application is the direct detection of chemicals on surfaces without requiring sample preparation, such as wiping or solvent extraction. DART has demonstrated success in sampling hundreds of chemicals, including chemical agents and their signatures, pharmaceutics, metabolites, peptides and oligosaccharides, synthetic organics, organometallics, drugs of abuse, explosives, and toxic industrial chemicals. These species were detected on various surfaces, such as concrete, asphalt, human skin, currency, airline boarding passes, business cards, fruits, vegetables, spices, beverages, body fluids, horticultural leaves, cocktail glasses, and clothing. DART employs no radioactive components and is more versatile than devices using radioisotope-based ionization. Because its response is instantaneous, DART provides real-time information, a critical requirement for screening or high throughput.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.chroma.2006.12.056},
  abstract = {The coupling of planar chromatography with direct analysis in real time time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DART-TOF-MS) was shown for the first time. Cutting the plate within a track led to substance zones positioned on the plate edge which were directly introduced into the DART gas stream. Mass signals were obtained instantaneously within seconds. Detectability was shown in the very low ng-range per zone on the example of isopropylthioxanthone. The coupling was perfectly suited for identification and qualitative purposes, but it was initially critical for quantification of results. Analytical response (R2 0.8202) and repeatability were strongly dependent from proper manual positioning of the HPTLC plate into the electronic or vibronic excited-state gas stream of the ion source. This drawback was overcome by using stable isotope-labeled standards shown on the example of caffeine. This way, analytical response (R2 0.9892) and repeatability (RSD $<$ +/- 5.4\%, n=6) were improved to a high extent. Spatial resolution by an in-house-built plate holder system was shown to be better than 3 mm. The decay of the signal was observed. The efficacy of this new coupling was compared to a plunger-based extraction device for HPTLC/electrospray ionisation-MS. The latter device showed detectability down to the pg-range, e.g. the limit of quantification for isopropylthioxanthone was found to be 100 pg. Repeatability was comparable (RSD +/- 6.7\%), however, without the need of internal standard correction. Analytical response was slightly better and showed a determination coefficient R2 of 0.9983. Similar data were obtained for caffeine as well. Spatial resolution was 2 mm or 4 mm depending on the plunger head used. The comparison showed that HPTLC/DART-TOF-MS is a useful coupling method regarding qualitative aspects and it has the potential to cope also with the difficulties of quantification if isotope-labeled standards were used or if a plate holder system is employed as initially shown.},

The tools perform proteomics data analyses; the libraries enable rapid tool creation by providing a robust, pluggable development framework that simplifies and unifies data file access, and performs standard proteomics and LCMS dataset computations. The library contains readers and writers of the mzML data format, which has been written using modern C++ techniques and design principles and supports a variety of platforms with native compilers. The software has been specifically released under the Apache v2 license to ensure it can be used in both academic and commercial projects. In addition to the library, we also introduce a rapidly growing set of companion tools whose implementation helps to illustrate the simplicity of developing applications on top of the ProteoWizard library., Availability: Cross-platform software that compiles using native compilers (i.e. GCC on Linux, MSVC on Windows and XCode on OSX) is available for download free of charge, at http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net. This website also provides code examples, and documentation. It is our hope the ProteoWizard project will become a standard platform for proteomics development; consequently, code use, contribution and further development are strongly encouraged., Contact: darren@proteowizard.org; parag@ucla.edu, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jasms.2007.07.027},
  abstract = {A new ion source based on dielectric barrier discharge was developed as an alternative ionization source for ambient mass spectrometry. The dielectric barrier discharge ionization source, termed as DBDI herein, was composed of a copper sheet electrode, a discharge electrode, and a piece of glass slide in between as dielectric barrier as well as sample plate. Stable low-temperature plasma was formed between the tip of the discharge electrode and the surface of glass slide when an alternating voltage was applied between the electrodes. Analytes deposited on the surface of the glass slide were desorbed and ionized by the plasma and the ions were introduced to the mass spectrometer for mass analysis. The capability of this new ambient ion source was demonstrated with the analysis of 20 amino acids, which were deposited on the glass slide separately. Protonated molecular ions of [M + H](+) were observed for all the amino acids except for L-arginine. This ion source was also used for a rapid discrimination of L-valine, L-proline, L-serine and L-alanine from their mixture. The limit of detection was 3.5 pmol for L-alanine using single-ion-monitoring (SIM). Relative standard deviation (RSD) was 5.78\% for 17.5 nmol of L-alanine (n = 5). With the advantages of small size, simple configuration and ease operation at ambient conditions, the dielectric barrier discharge ion source would potentially be coupled to portable mass spectrometers.},

  abstract = {Trace amounts of explosives on solid surfaces were detected by mass spectrometry at ambient conditions with a new technique termed dielectric barrier discharge ionization (DBDI). By the needle-plate discharge mode, a plasma discharge with energetic electrons was generated, which could launch the desorption and ionization of the explosives from solid surfaces. Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) were desorbed directly from the explosives-contaminated surface by DBDI, forming the typical anions of [TNT](-), [TNT - H](-), [RDX + NO(2)](-), [PETN + ONO(2)](-), and [RDX + ONO(2)](-). The ions were transferred into the MS instrument for analysis in the negative ion mode. The detection limit of present method was 10 pg for TNT (m/z 197, S/N 8 : 1), 0.1 ng for RDX (m/z 284, S/N 10 : 1), and 1 ng for PETN (m/z 260, S/N 12 : 1). The present method allowed the detection of trace explosives on various matrices, including paper, cloth, chemical fiber, glass, paints, and soil. A relative standard deviation of 5.57\% was achieved by depositing 100 pg of TNT on these matrices. The analysis of A-5, a mixture of RDX and additives, has been carried out and the results were consistent with the reference values. The DBDI-MS method represents a simple and rapid way for the detection of explosives with high sensitivity and specificity, which is especially useful when they are present in trace amounts on ordinary environmental surfaces.},

  abstract = {A novel plasma-assisted desorption/ionization (PADI) method that can be coupled with atmospheric pressure sampling mass spectrometry to yield mass spectral information under ambient conditions of pressure and humidity from a range of surfaces without the requirement for sample preparation or additives is reported. PADI is carried out by generating a nonthermal plasma which interacts directly with the surface of the analyte. Desorption and ionization then occur at the surface, and ions are sampled by the mass spectrometer. The PADI technique is demonstrated and compared with desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) for the detection of active ingredients in a range of over-the-counter and prescription pharmaceutical formulations, including nonsterodial anti-inflammatory drugs (mefenamic acid, Ibugel, and ibuprofen), analgesics (paracetamol, Anadin Extra), and Beecham's "all in one" cold and flu remedy. PADI has also been successfully applied to the analysis of nicotine in tobacco and thiosulfates in garlic. PADI experiments have been performed using a prototype source interfaced with a Waters Platform LCZ single-quadrupole mass spectrometer with limited modifications and a Hiden Analytical HPR-60 molecular beam mass spectrometer (MBMS). The ability of PADI to rapidly detect active ingredients in pharmaceuticals without the need for prior sample preparation, solvents, or exposed high voltages demonstrates the potential of the technique for high-throughput screening in a pharmaceutical or forensic environment.},

This new source uses a glow discharge in the flowing afterglow mode for the generation of excited species and ions. The direct-current gas discharge is operated in helium at atmospheric pressure; typical operating voltages and currents are around 500 V and 25 mA, respectively. The species generated by this atmospheric pressure glow discharge are mixed with ambient air to generate reagent ions (mostly ionized water clusters and NO+), which are then used for the ionization of gaseous organic compounds. A wide variety of substances, both polar and nonpolar, can be ionized. The resulting mass spectra generally show the parent molecular ion (M+ or MH+) with little or no fragmentation. Proton transfer from ionized water clusters has been identified as the main ionization pathway. However, the presence of radical molecular ions (M+) for some compounds indicates that other ionization mechanisms are also involved. The analytical capabilities of this source were evaluated with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and preliminary characterization shows very good stability, linearity, and sensitivity.

With increased current densities, temperatures of up to 50000 K could be reached.

  abstract = {Rationale

The genus Dalbergia includes approximately 250 species worldwide. Of these, 58 species are of economic importance and listed under CITES. Identification of illegal transnational timber trade is a challenge because logs or boards lack the typical descriptors used for species identification such as leaves and flowers; therefore, frequently the lowest taxonomic determination of these tree byproducts is genus. In this study, we explore the use of Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (TOFMS) in making species determinations of protected Dalbergia trees from Africa, Madagascar, and Asia.

Methods

Metabolic profiles were collected using DART TOFMS from the heartwood of seven species and the sapwood of 17 species of Dalbergia. Also included in this study are 85 Dalbergia heartwood samples from Madagascar that were only identified to genus. In all, 21 species comprising 235 specimens were analyzed, the metabolic chemotypes were interpreted, and the spectra were analyzed using chemometric tools.

Results

Dalbergia cochinchinensis and Dalbergia spp. from Madagascar (both CITES Appendix II) could be differentiated from each other and from the non-protected Dalbergia latifolia and Dalbergia melanoxylon.

Conclusions

DART TOFMS is a valuable high-throughput tool useful for making phytochemical classifications of Dalbergia spp. The data produced allows the protected Dalbergias from Madagascar to be distinguished and can differentiate closely related rosewood trees.

  abstract = {The reactors considered so far consist of a plasma source which is either spatially connected with the processing chamber (DC reactors and CCP reactors) or partially separated as in the high-density reactors, which are spoken of ``downstream''reactors. Spatial separation between plasma source and processing chamber leads to ion beam processing which was initially pushed by NASA at the end of the 1950s when they dreamt of interplanetary missions which chould be made feasible with ion thrusters [303, 304]. For optimized thrust, the fuels should combine high atomic weight with low ionization potential to facilitate high ion densities and high a momentum at the same power input. Simultaneously, corrosion should be kept at low a level. Therefore, most experiments were performed with mercury (instead of cesium). This research remained but a dream, but as a typical spin-off process, these systems were identified as plasma sources for inert gas processing.},

Finer tuning leads to resonant methods (ECR and helicon) and non-resonant techniques (CCP and ICP). Concerning the type of etching, we discriminate between ion beam etching [(IBE), pressure below 10-4 Torr], ion etching (at least one order of magnitude higher), and plasma etching (another order of magnitude higher). Resonant methods are operated in the intermediate range between ion beam etching and ion etching. For resonant methods, the etch rates are second to none, next in line is ICP which is superior to CCP. We can also make a distinction between etching reactors which are operated downstream (ECR, helicon, ICP, and IB) and others with a parallel-plate reactor (DC and LF, CCP).},

Reporting of standard metadata provides a biological and empirical context for the data, facilitates experimental replication, and enables the re-interrogation and comparison of data by others. Accordingly, the Metabolomics Standards Initiative is building a general consensus concerning the minimum reporting standards for metabolomics experiments of which the Chemical Analysis Working Group (CAWG) is a member of this community effort. This article proposes the minimum reporting standards related to the chemical analysis aspects of metabolomics experiments including: sample preparation, experimental analysis, quality control, metabolite identification, and data pre-processing. These minimum standards currently focus mostly upon mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy due to the popularity of these techniques in metabolomics. However, additional input concerning other techniques is welcomed and can be provided via the CAWG on-line discussion forum at http://msi-workgroups.sourceforge.net/ or http://Msi-workgroups-feedback@lists.sourceforge.net.

Different mass spectrometers output their raw spectral data in a variety of proprietary formats, and alternative methods that assign peptides to MS/MS spectra and infer protein identifications from those peptide assignments each write their results in different formats. Here we describe an MS/MS analysis platform, the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, which makes use of open XML file formats for storage of data at the raw spectral data, peptide, and protein levels. This platform enables uniform analysis and exchange of MS/MS data generated from a variety of different instruments, and assigned peptides using a variety of different database search programs. We demonstrate this by applying the pipeline to data sets generated by ThermoFinnigan LCQ, ABI 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF, and Waters Q-TOF instruments, and searched in turn using SEQUEST, Mascot, and COMET.},

Although very fruitful, these studies have not allowed for the examination of mechanisms across a phylogenetic spectrum. The exploration of natural patterns of metabolic pool size variation across species will help us to better understand the genetics of metabolic adaptation.

We examined the metabolic pools size (triglyceride, glycogen and protein) at two ages in 12 Drosophila species with distinctly different ecologies for which complete genome sequences (for 11 of the 12 species) are known. Overall, there were significant differences across species for all three pools, while age and sex appear to affect some metabolic pools more than others. After correcting for the phylogenetic relatedness of the species used, we observed no association between triglyceride and glycogen content. Although within species these two pools sometimes are correlated, at a larger phylogenetic scale control of triglyceride and glycogen contents may have been shaped independently by natural selection.},

  abstract = {We examined the effects of 3 diets differing in their relative levels of sugar and protein on development and metabolic pools (protein, TG, and glycogen) among sets of isofemale lines of 2 ecologically distinct Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. mojavensis. Our high protein:sugar ratio diet contained 7.1\% protein and 17.9\% carbohydrate, the EPS diet was 4.3\% protein and 21.2\% carbohydrate, and the LPS was only 2.5\% protein and 24.6\% carbohydrate. Larvae of D. melanogaster, a generalist fruit breeder, were able to survive on all 3 diets, although all 3 metabolic pools responded with significant diet and diet \texttimes{} line interactions. Development was delayed by the diet with the most sugar relative to protein. The other species, D. mojavensis, a cactus breeder ecologically unaccustomed to encountering simple sugars, completely failed to survive when fed the diet with the highest sugar and showed very poor survival even with the diet with equal parts of protein and sugar. Furthermore, the D. mojavensis adult metabolic pools of protein, TG, and glycogen significantly differed from those of D. melanogaster adults fed the identical diet. Thus, considerable within- and between-species differences exist in how diets are metabolized. Given that the genomes of both of these Drosophila species have been sequenced, these differences and their genetic underpinnings hold promise for understanding human responses to nutrition and for developing strategies for dealing with metabolic disease.},

Post source decay of protonated capsaicin ion revealed structural information of the corresponding acid amide of vanillylamide and C 9  chain fatty acid. MALDI-TOF-MSI confirmed that localization of capsaicin in the placenta is higher than that in the pericarp. In addition, it revealed no localization of capsaicin in seed and the higher localization of capsaicin at placenta surface compared with that in the internal region. A quantitative difference was detected between localizations of capsaicin at placenta, pericarp and seed in the  capsicum  fruits.

In addition, all genotypes were evaluated for taste by a trained descriptive sensory expert panel. Metabolic contrasts between genotypes were caused by clusters of volatile and non-volatile compounds, which could be related to metabolic pathways and common biochemical precursors. Clusters of phenolic derivatives, higher alkanes, sesquiterpenes and lipid derived volatiles formed the major determinants of the genotypic differences. Flavour was described with the use of 14 taste attributes, of which the texture related attributes and the sweet\textendash{}sour contrast were the most discriminatory factors. The attributes juiciness, toughness, crunchiness, stickiness, sweetness, aroma, sourness and fruity/apple taste could be significantly predicted with combined volatile and non-volatile data. Fructose and (E)-2-hexen-1-ol were highly correlated with aroma, fruity/apple taste and sweetness. New relations were found for fruity/apple taste and sweetness with the compounds p-menth-1-en-9-al, (E)-$\beta$-ocimene, (Z)-2-penten-1-ol and (E)-geranylacetone. Based on the overall biochemical and sensory results, the perspectives for flavour improvement by breeding are discussed.},

  abstract = {The steam volatile components of chile pepper (Capsicum annuum L. var. glabriusculum) at two ripening stages (green and red) were analysed using GC and GC\textendash{}MS; 140 constituents were identified, of which hexyl isopentanoate, hexyl 2-methylbutanoate, limonene, hexyl isohexanoate, (E)-2-hexenal, isopentyl isopentanoate and (Z)-3-hexenyl isopentanoate were found to be the major constituents. During fruit maturation, the majority of volatile compounds decreased. In general, green chile peppers have higher amounts of esters, with their fruity odour notes, than red fruits. Attending to the differences in the amount of total volatiles, which is higher at the green stage in comparison with the mature stage, it can be concluded that the green stage is better in terms of its flavour than the red stage.

  abstract = {Scientific workflows have emerged as an important tool for combining the computational power with data analysis for all scientific domains in e-science, especially in the life sciences. They help scientists to design and execute complex in silico experiments. However, with rising complexity it becomes increasingly impractical to optimize scientific workflows by trial and error. To address this issue, we propose to insert a new optimization phase into the common scientific workflow life cycle. This paper describes the design and implementation of an automated optimization framework for scientific workflows to implement this phase. Our framework was integrated into Taverna, a life-science oriented workflow management system and offers a versatile programming interface (API), which enables easy integration of arbitrary optimization methods. We have used this API to develop an example plugin for parameter optimization that is based on a Genetic Algorithm. Two use cases taken from the areas of structural bioinformatics and proteomics demonstrate how our framework facilitates setup, execution, and monitoring of workflow parameter optimization in high performance computing e-science environments.},

  abstract = {One challenge in Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM)-based proteomics is to select the most appropriate surrogate peptides to represent a target protein. We present here a software package to automatically generate these most appropriate surrogate peptides for an LC/MRM\textendash{}MS analysis. Our method integrates information about the proteins, their tryptic peptides, and the suitability of these peptides for MRM which is available online in UniProtKB, NCBI's dbSNP, ExPASy, PeptideAtlas, PRIDE, and GPMDB. The scoring algorithm reflects our knowledge in choosing the best candidate peptides for MRM, based on the uniqueness of the peptide in the targeted proteome, its physiochemical properties, and whether it previously has been observed. The modularity of the workflow allows further extension and additional selection criteria to be incorporated. We have developed a simple Web interface where the researcher provides the protein accession number, the subject organism, and peptide-specific options. Currently, the software is designed for human and mouse proteomes, but additional species can be easily be added. Our software improved the peptide selection by eliminating human error, considering multiple data sources and all of the isoforms of the protein, and resulted in faster peptide selection \textemdash{} approximately 50 proteins per hour compared to 8 per day.
Biological significance
Compiling a list of optimal surrogate peptides for target proteins to be analyzed by LC/MRM\textendash{}MS has been a cumbersome process, in which expert researchers retrieved information from different online repositories and used their own reasoning to find the most appropriate peptides. Our scientific workflow automates this process by integrating information from different data sources including UniProt, Global Proteome Machine, NCBI's dbSNP, and PeptideAtlas, simulating the researchers' reasoning, and incorporating their knowledge of how to select the best proteotypic peptides for an MRM analysis. The developed software can help to standardize the selection of peptides, eliminate human error, and increase productivity.},

However, the technology is not mature and multiple research groups in both academia and industry are still very actively studying the fundamentals of imaging techniques, adapting the technology to new ionization sources, and developing new applications. As a result, there important varieties of data file formats used to store mass spectrometry imaging data and, concurrent to the development of MSi, collaborative efforts have been undertaken to introduce common imaging data file formats. However, few free software packages to read and analyze files of these different formats are readily available. We introduce here MSiReader, a free open source application to read and analyze high resolution MSI data from the most common MSi data formats. The application is built on the Matlab platform (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) and includes a large selection of data analysis tools and features. People who are unfamiliar with the Matlab language will have little difficult navigating the user-friendly interface, and users with Matlab programming experience can adapt and customize MSiReader for their own needs.},

Here we have investigated the effects of inbreeding on the Drosophila melanogaster metabolome. Metabolite fingerprints in males from five outbred and five inbred lines were studied by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy after exposure to benign temperature, heat stress, or cold stress. In both the absence and the presence of temperature stress, metabolite levels were significantly different among inbred and outbred lines. The major effect of inbreeding was increased levels of maltose and decreased levels of 3-hydroxykynurenine and a galactoside [1-O-(4-O-(2-aminoethyl phosphate)-$\beta$-d-galactopyranosyl)-x-glycerol] synthesized exclusively in the paragonial glands of Drosophila species, including D. melanogaster. The metabolomic effect of inbreeding at the benign temperature was related to gene expression data from the same inbred and outbred lines. Both gene expression and metabolite data indicate that fundamental metabolic processes are changed or modified by inbreeding. Apart from affecting mean metabolite levels, inbreeding led to an increased between-line variation in metabolite profiles compared to outbred lines. In contrast to previous observations revealing interactions between inbreeding and environmental stress on gene expression patterns and life-history traits, the effect of inbreeding on the metabolite profile was similar across the different temperature treatments.},

Samples of fruit flesh and placenta plus seeds were analysed separately. Several terpenoids, esters, alkanes, as well as other minor compounds relevant for the aroma, including 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine, methyl salicylate, and $\alpha$-ionone, were identified. Remarkable differences, both qualitative and quantitative, were found for the volatile composition of the parent accessions. In hybrids a number of compounds comprised between or higher than in the corresponding parents was detected, while intermediate or transgressive inheritance for both total and individual volatiles was observed. Differences between fruit flesh and placenta/seeds were mostly quantitative, as we could not detect compound-specificity in these tissues. In most cases, both total and individual volatiles were higher in the placenta/seeds samples. This effect was particularly important in hybrids, with levels of total volatiles in the placenta up to 14-fold those of the fruit flesh. Our results suggest that there are ample opportunities for improving the aroma of Capsicum peppers by means of hybridization.},

  abstract = {Results are presented on the characterisation and optimisation of a non-thermal atmospheric pressure micro-plasma ion source used for ambient mass spectrometry imaging. The geometry of the experiment is optimised to produce the most intense and stable ion signals. Signal stabilities (relative standard deviation) of 2.3-6.5\% are achieved for total ion current measurements from chromatograms. Parameters are utilised to achieve MS imaging by raster scanning of PTFE/glass samples with a spatial resolution of 147 $\pm$ 31 $\mu$m. A systematic study of resolution as a function of acquisition parameters was also undertaken to underpin future technique development. Mass spectra are obtained from PTFE/glass sample edges in negative ion mode and used to construct images to calculate the spatial resolution. Images are constructed using the intensity variation of the dominant ion observed in the PTFE spectrum. Mass spectra originating from the polymer are dominated by three series of ions in a m/z spectral window from 200-500 Da. These ions are each separated by 50 Da and have the chemical formula [C2F + [CF2]n](-), [CF + [CF2]n + O](-) and [CF + [CF2]n + O3](-). The mechanism for the generation of these ions appears to be a polymer chain scission followed by ionisation by atmospheric ion adduction. Positive and negative ion mode mass spectra of personal care products, amino acids and pharmaceuticals, dominated by the proton abstracted/protonated molecular ion, highlight the potential areas of application for such a device. Further to this end a mass spectral image of cardamom seeds, constructed using the variation in intensity of possible fragments of the 1,8-cineole molecule, is included to reveal the potential application to the imaging of foods and other biological materials.},

  abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (volatiles) comprise a chemically diverse class of low molecular weight organic compounds having an appreciable vapor pressure under ambient conditions. Volatiles produced by plants attract pollinators and seed dispersers, and provide defense against pests and pathogens. For insects, volatiles may act as pheromones directing social behavior or as cues for finding hosts or prey. For humans, volatiles are important as flavorants and as possible disease biomarkers. The marine environment is also a major source of halogenated and sulfur-containing volatiles which participate in the global cycling of these elements. While volatile analysis commonly measures a rather restricted set of analytes, the diverse and extreme physical properties of volatiles provide unique analytical challenges. Volatiles constitute only a small proportion of the total number of metabolites produced by living organisms, however, because of their roles as signaling molecules (semiochemicals) both within and between organisms, accurately measuring and determining the roles of these compounds is crucial to an integrated understanding of living systems. This review summarizes recent developments in volatile research from a metabolomics perspective with a focus on the role of recent technical innovation in developing new areas of volatile research and expanding the range of ecological interactions which may be mediated by volatile organic metabolites.},

  abstract = {Plants have the capacity to synthesize, accumulate and emit volatiles that may act as aroma and flavor molecules due to interactions with human receptors. These low-molecular-weight substances derived from the fatty acid, amino acid and carbohydrate pools constitute a heterogenous group of molecules with saturated and unsaturated, straight-chain, branched-chain and cyclic structures bearing various functional groups (e.g. alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters and ethers) and also nitrogen and sulfur. They are commercially important for the food, pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical industries as flavorants, drugs, pesticides and industrial feedstocks. Due to the low abundance of the volatiles in their plant sources, many of the natural products had been replaced by their synthetic analogues by the end of the last century. However, the foreseeable shortage of the crude oil that is the source for many of the artificial flavors and fragrances has prompted recent interest in understanding the formation of these compounds and engineering their biosynthesis. Although many of the volatile constituents of flavors and aromas have been identified, many of the enzymes and genes involved in their biosynthesis are still not known. However, modification of flavor by genetic engineering is dependent on the knowledge and availability of genes that encode enzymes of key reactions that influence or divert the biosynthetic pathways of plant-derived volatiles. Major progress has resulted from the use of molecular and biochemical techniques, and a large number of genes encoding enzymes of volatile biosynthesis have recently been reported.},

  abstract = {Metabolic fingerprinting, the main tool in metabolomics, is a non-targeted methodology where all detectable peaks (or signals), including those from unknown analytes, are considered to establish sample classification. After pattern comparison, those signals changing in response to a specific situation under investigation are identified to gain biological insight. For this purpose, gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) has a drawback in that only volatile compounds or compounds that can be made volatile after derivatization can be analysed, and derivatization often requires extensive sample treatment. However, once the analysis is focused on low molecular weight metabolites, GC-MS is highly efficient, sensitive, and reproducible. Moreover, it is quantitative, and its compound identification capabilities are superior to other separation techniques because GC-MS instruments obtain mass spectra with reproducible fragmentation patterns, which allow for the creation of public databases. This chapter describes well-established protocols for metabolic fingerprinting (i.e. the comprehensive analysis of small molecules) in plasma and urine using GC-MS. Guidelines will also be provided regarding subsequent data pre-treatment, pattern recognition, and marker identification.},

  abstract = {Plants use inducible defence mechanisms to fend off harmful organisms. Resistance that is induced in response to local attack is often expressed systemically, that is, in organs that are not yet damaged. In the search for translocated defence signals, biochemical studies follow the physical movement of putative signals, and grafting experiments use mutants that are impaired in the production or perception of these signals. Long-distance signals can directly activate defence or can prime for the stronger and faster induction of defence. Historically, research has focused on the vascular transport of signalling metabolites, but volatiles can play a crucial role as well. We compare the advantages and constraints of vascular and airborne signals for the plant, and discuss how they can act in synergy to achieve optimised resistance in distal plant parts.},

Whereas peltate glands and type I capitate trichomes were always present, type II capitate glands were not found in all leaf samples. The histochemical study suggested an `endodermal' role for the stalk cell (peltate and capitate type I) as well as for the neck cell (capitate type II), preventing the loss of essential oil. Histological reactions also revealed the complex nature of the material secreted by all types ofS. aurea trichome, including polysaccharides, polyphenols and proteins, in addition to the essential oil. Qualitative and quantitative GC-MS analysis of the essential oil revealed camphor to be the main constituent. The findings are discussed in relation to studies of trichomes from other members of the Lamiaceae.},

Genes for PV biosynthesis evolve by duplication of genes that direct other aspects of plant metabolism; these duplicated genes then diverge from each other over time. Changes in the preferred substrate or resultant product of PV enzymes may occur through minimal changes of critical residues.

Three compounds (cis-3-hexen-1-ol, linalool, and cis-$\alpha$-bergamotene) increased egg predation rates by a generalist predator; linalool and the complete blend decreased lepidopteran oviposition rates. As a consequence, a plant could reduce the number of herbivores by more than 90\% by releasing volatiles. These results confirm that indirect defenses can operate in nature.},

Small C6 molecules termed green-leaf volatiles form a general element in most of these blends; however, the overall composition is usually sufficiently specific that other organisms are able to determine the nature of the attacker. Receivers of herbivore-induced volatile organic compounds (HI-VOCs) comprise distant parts of the same plant (`within-plant signalling'), neighbouring plants (`plant\textendash{}plant signalling'), herbivores, and multiple carnivores that respond to the `plant's cry for help', such as parasitoids and hyperparasitoids, entomopathogenic nematodes, and predatory mites, beetles, bugs and birds. In spite of intensive research efforts, many central questions still remain. How do plants perceive volatiles? What is the relative impact of each of the interactions with different receivers of HI-VOCs on the fitness of the emitting plant and that of the interacting organisms? How long can these compounds remain stable in the atmosphere? Why are VOC-mediated effects on herbivores and beneficial organisms not used as a common tool in sustainable agriculture? Here, I briefly summarize the ecological effects of HI-VOC perception and discuss the most pertinent questions raised by participants at the 32nd New Phytologist Symposium in Buenos Aires.},

These characteristics increase the interest in this compound class, hence the capsaicinoid analysis must be reproducible and accurate. This study aimed to develop and validate a fast, efficient and reproducible method to analyze capsaicinoids in Brazilian Capsicum chinense fruits. The extracts were obtained after an optimization step that indicated the condition 100\% of methanol and 10 min on ultrasound assisted extraction. The analyses were carried out in an ultra high performance liquid chromatographic system with detection by a photo diode array and mass spectrometer. The analytical method developed permits the separation of 8 capsaicinoids in 4 min of time analysis expending only 2 mL of solvent as mobile phase. The validation parameters evaluated for the method show the effectiveness and satisfactory performance to answer the analytical needs of this research area, presenting low values to relative standard deviation in repeatability and reproducibility and recoveries ranged from 88 to 112\% for capsaicin and 89 to 109\% for dihydrocapsaicin. In the extracts from different accessions of C. chinense fruits analyzed, the contents of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were in the range of 156\textendash{}1442 $\mu$g g- 1 and 26\textendash{}478 $\mu$g g- 1 of fresh fruit, respectively, showing the large application of this method for quantification of the two major capsaicinoids in fast routine analysis and may be used to determine the concentrations of other minor capsaicinoids once appropriate standards are available.},

Here, we report that it has a profound antiproliferative effect on prostate cancer cells, inducing the apoptosis of both androgen receptor (AR)-positive (LNCaP) and -negative (PC-3, DU-145) prostate cancer cell lines associated with an increase of p53, p21, and Bax. Capsaicin down-regulated the expression of not only prostate-specific antigen (PSA) but also AR. Promoter assays showed that capsaicin inhibited the ability of dihydrotestosterone to activate the PSA promoter/enhancer even in the presence of exogenous AR in LNCaP cells, suggesting that capsaicin inhibited the transcription of PSA not only via down-regulation of expression of AR, but also by a direct inhibitory effect on PSA transcription. Capsaicin inhibited NF-$\kappa$ activation by preventing its nuclear migration. In further studies, capsaicin inhibited tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$\textendash{}stimulated degradation of I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ in PC-3 cells, which was associated with the inhibition of proteasome activity. Taken together, capsaicin inhibits proteasome activity which suppressed the degradation of I$\kappa$B$\alpha$, preventing the activation of NF-$\kappa$B. Capsaicin, when given orally, significantly slowed the growth of PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts as measured by size [75 $\pm$ 35 versus 336 $\pm$ 123 mm3 ($\pm$SD); P = 0.017] and weight [203 $\pm$ 41 versus 373 $\pm$ 52 mg ($\pm$SD); P = 0.0006; capsaicin-treated versus vehicle-treated mice, respectively].

Previous research has suggested that decreased preadipocyte differentiation and proliferation and decreased lipogenesis are mechanisms to reduce obesity. In the present study, the effects of capsaicin on the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes were investigated. The results demonstrated that capsaicin decreased cell population growth of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, assessed with the MTT assay. Flow cytometric analysis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes exposed to capsaicin showed that apoptotic cells increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Treatment with capsaicin decreased the number of normal cells and increased the number of early apoptotic and late apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner. The treatment of cells with capsaicin caused the loss of mitochondria membrane potential (??m). The induction of apoptosis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by capsaicin was mediated through the activation of caspase-3, Bax, and Bak, and then through the cleavage of PARP and the down-regulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, capsaicin significantly decreased the amount of intracellular triglycerides and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Capsaicin also inhibited the expression of PPAR?, C/EBP$\alpha$, and leptin, but induced up-regulation of adiponectin at the protein level. These results demonstrate that capsaicin efficiently induces apoptosis and inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes.

  abstract = {Since noncovalent protein macrocomplexes are implicated in many cellular functions, their characterization is essential to understand how they drive several biological processes. Over the past 20 years, because of its high sensitivity, mass spectrometry has been described as a powerful tool for both the protein identification in macrocomplexes and the understanding of the macrocomplexes organization. Nonetheless, stabilizing these protein macrocomplexes, by introducing covalent bonds, is a prerequisite before their analysis by the denaturing mass spectrometry technique. In this study, using the Hsp90/Aha1 macrocomplex as a model (where Hsp denotes a heat shock protein), we optimized a double cross-linking protocol with 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide (EDC). This protocol takes place in a two-step process: initially, a cross-linking is performed according to a previously optimized protocol, and then a second cross-linking is performed by increasing the EDC concentration, counterbalanced by a high dilution of sample and, thus, protein macrocomplexes. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, we verified the efficiency of our optimized protocol by submitting (or not submitting) samples to the K200 MALDI MS analysis kit containing N-succinimidyl iodo-acetate, suberic acid bis(3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester), suberic acid bis(N-hydroxysuccinimide ester), disuccinimidyl tartrate, and dithiobis(succinimidyl) propionate, developed by the CovalX Company. Results obtained show that our optimized cross-linking protocol allows a complete stabilization of protein macrocomplexes and appears to be very accurate. Indeed, contrary to other cross-linkers, the ?zero-length? feature of the EDC reagent prevents overdetermination of the mass of complexes, because EDC does not remain as part of the linkage.},

All peptide carboxyl groups\textemdash{}aspartic and glutamic acid side-chains as well as C-termini\textemdash{}were derivatized with an average reaction efficiency of 99 \%. This nearly complete labeling avoids making complex peptide mixtures even more complex because of partially-labeled products, and it allows the use of static modifications during database searching. Alkyl tertiary amines were found to be the optimal labeling reagent among the four types tested. Charge states are substantially higher for derivatized peptides: a modified tryptic digest of bovine serum albumin (BSA) generates \textasciitilde{}90\% of its precursor ions with z $>$ 2, compared with less than 40 \% for the unmodified sample. The increased charge density of modified peptide ions yields highly efficient ETD fragmentation, leading to many additional peptide identifications and higher sequence coverage (e.g., 70 \% for modified versus only 43 \% for unmodified BSA). The utility of this labeling strategy was demonstrated on a tryptic digest of ribosomal proteins isolated from yeast cells. Peptide derivatization of this sample produced an increase in the number of identified proteins, a $>$50 \% increase in the sequence coverage of these proteins, and a doubling of the number of peptide spectral matches. This carboxyl derivatization strategy greatly improves proteome coverage obtained from ETD-MS/MS of tryptic digests, and we anticipate that it will also enhance identification and localization of post-translational modifications.

Traditionally, natural products discovery from microbial sources depends on the screening of target-mediated inhibition. The natural products identified through this strategy usually correlate to significant microbial phenotypes. However, the target-mediated transcriptions deduced from low concentrations of natural products sometimes do not generate an obvious phenotype. The better understanding of the true biological roles of those microbial natural products will permit the application of rational approaches to the more effective exploitation of their use. Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) has been developed and applied in many fields for decades. However, the applications of IMS on microbial natural products research have just been recently reported. IMS is one of few tools capable of revealing both phenotype and relevant and irrelevant chemotypes of microorganisms. In this review, we summarize the latest applications of IMS technologies. The challenges and prospect of improvement and application of IMS to microbial natural products research are discussed as well.},

Spray has been demonstrated with this cartridge for tens of minutes, without any external pumping. It is shown that fast wetting and spray generation can easily be achieved using a number of solvent mixtures commonly used for PSI. The PSI cartridge was applied to the analysis of lidocaine from a paper tip using different solvent mixtures, and to the analysis of lidocaine from a serum sample.

  abstract = {RATIONALE

Tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra generated by collision-induced dissociation (CID) typically lack redundant peptide sequence information in the form of e.g. b- and y-ion series due to frequent use of sequence-specific endopeptidases cleaving C- or N-terminal to Arg or Lys residues.

METHODS

Here we introduce arginyl-tRNA protein transferase (ATE, EC 2.3.2.8) for proteomics. ATE recognizes acidic amino acids or oxidized Cys at the N-terminus of a substrate peptide and conjugates an arginine from an aminoacylated tRNAArg onto the N-terminus of the substrate peptide. This enzymatic reaction is carried out under physiological conditions and, in combination with Lys-C/Asp-N double digest, results in arginylated peptides with basic amino acids on both termini.

RESULTS

We demonstrate that in vitro arginylation of peptides using yeast arginyl tRNA protein transferase 1 (yATE1) is a robust enzymatic reaction, specific to only modifying N-terminal acidic amino acids. Precursors originating from arginylated peptides generally have an increased protonation state compared with their non-arginylated forms. Furthermore, the product ion spectra of arginylated peptides show near complete 2\texttimes{} fragment ladders within the same MS/MS spectrum using commonly available electrospray ionization peptide fragmentation modes. Unexpectedly, arginylated peptides generate complete y- and c-ion series using electron transfer dissociation (ETD) despite having an internal proline residue.

CONCLUSIONS

We introduce a rapid enzymatic method to generate peptides flanked on either terminus by basic amino acids, resulting in a rich, redundant MS/MS fragment pattern. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors. Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

The aim of this work is to compare the performance of functionalized porous silicon surfaces (pSi) for small molecules analysis with regard to the stability of the signal and the limits of detection (LODs) observed in DESI-MS. The results showed that functional groups, like 1-decene and heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl trimethoxysilane, on pSi surface provides a good alternative for dried spot analysis by DESI-MS, improving stability of the signal and the LODs. This improvement is possible because the dual process containing the weak sample-surface interactions of the hydrophobic characteristic of the functional groups and increasing the surface area of interaction between the sample and the thin solvent film created by the DESI spray, resulting in more effective dissolution of the analyte in the spray solvent without fast removal of the sample.},

In this study a special solvent tank was designed and the TLC strip was mounted horizontally where the solvent would flow down. A very small funnel right below the TLC tip collected the solvent and transferred it to a needle via a capillary tubing. Using the TLC-ESI-IMS technique, acceptable separations were achieved for two component mixtures of morphine-papaverine and acridine-papaverine. A special injection port was designed to host the pieces cut off the TLC. The method was successfully used to identify each spot on the TLC by IMS in a few seconds.},

  abstract = {We present an origami paper-based electrophoretic device (oPAD-Ep) that achieves rapid (?5 min) separation of fluorescent molecules and proteins. Due to the innovative design, the required driving voltage is just ?10 V, which is more than 10 times lower than that used for conventional electrophoresis. The oPAD-Ep uses multiple, thin (180 ?m/layer) folded paper layers as the supporting medium for electrophoresis. This approach significantly shortens the distance between the anode and cathode, and this, in turn, accounts for the high electric field ($>$1 kV/m) that can be achieved even with a low applied voltage. The multilayer design of the oPAD-Ep enables convenient sample introduction by use of a slip layer as well as easy product analysis and reclamation after electrophoresis by unfolding the origami paper and cutting out desired layers. We demonstrate the use of oPAD-Ep for simple separation of proteins in bovine serum, which illustrates its potential applications for point-of-care diagnostic testing.},

There are many different search engines, both commercial and open source, each employing a somewhat different technique for spectrum identification. The set of high-scoring peptide-spectrum matches for a defined set of input spectra differs markedly among the various search engine results; individual engines each provide unique correct identifications among a core set of correlative identifications. This has led to the approach of combining the results from multiple search engines to achieve improved analysis of each dataset. Here we review the techniques and available software for combining the results of multiple search engines and briefly compare the relative performance of these techniques.},

The fast-flow on-line extraction technique is a different high-throughput approach that has also significantly speeded up analysis by LC/MS/MS. The use of pierceable caps for biological tubes further enhances the analysis speed and improves the safety in handling biological samples. The need for adequate chromatographic separation in order to eliminate interferences due to metabolites and/or matrix effects in LC/MS/MS is discussed. To highlight our limited understanding of atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry, results from recent investigations that appear to be counter-intuitive are presented. Looking ahead to the future, multiplexed LC/MS/MS systems and capillary LC are presented as areas that can bring about further improvements in analysis speed and sensitivity to quantitative bioanalysis by LC/MS/MS.},

We also have developed databases for retrieving metabolites related to plants used for a range of purposes. In our multifaceted plant usage DB, medicinal/edible plants are related to the geographic zones (GZs) where the plants are used, their biological activities, and formulae of Japanese and Indonesian traditional medicines (Kampo and Jamu, respectively). These data are connected to the species-metabolites relationship DB within the KNApSAcK Core DB, keyed via the species names. All databases can be accessed via the website http://kanaya.naist.jp/KNApSAcK\_Family/. KNApSAcK WorldMap DB comprises 41,548 GZ-plant pair entries, including 222 GZs and 15,240 medicinal/edible plants.

The Biological Activity DB consists of 2,418 biological activities and 33,706 pairwise relationships between medicinal plants and their biological activities. Current statistics of the binary relationships between individual databases were characterized by the degree distribution analysis, leading to a prediction of at least 1,060,000 metabolites within all plants.

  abstract = {CAPSULE Effective visualizations have a wide scope of challenges. The paper offers guidelines, a perception-based color space alternative to the famous RGB color space and several tools to more effectively convey graphical information to viewers. Results of many atmospheric science applications are processed graphically. Visualizations are a powerful tool to display and communicate (complex) data. But to create effective figures wide scopes of challenges have to be considered. Therefore, this paper offers several guidelines with a focus on colors. Colors are often used to add additional information or to code information. Colors should (i) allow humans to process the information rapidly, (ii) guide the reader to the most important information, and (iii) represent the data appropriately without misleading distortion. The second and third requirements necessitate tailoring the visualization, and the use of colors, to the specific purpose of the graphic. A standard way of deriving color palettes is via transitions through a particular color space. Most of the common software packages still provide default palettes derived in the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color model or ``simple'' transformations thereof. Confounding perceptual properties such as hue and brightness make RGB-based palettes more prone to misinterpretation. Switching to a color model corresponding to the perceptual dimensions of human color vision avoids these problems. We show several practically relevant examples using one such model, the Hue-Chroma-Luminance (HCL) color model, to explain how it works and what its advantages are. Moreover, the paper contains several tips on how to easily integrate this knowledge into software commonly used by the community. The guidelines and examples should help readers to switch over to the alternative HCL color model, which will result in a greatly improved quality and readability of visualized atmospheric science data for research, teaching, and communication of results to society.},

This is of particular significance in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), where ion images that provide 2D distributions of a wide range of analytes are used to draw conclusions about the observed system. Commonly employed colour schemes are generally suboptimal for providing an accurate representation of the maximum amount of data.

Due to their widespread use, it is now time to perform a systematic analysis of the various algorithms currently in use. Using blood specimens used in the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project, we have evaluated five search algorithms with respect to their sensitivity and specificity, and have also accurately benchmarked them based on specified false-positive (FP) rates. Spectrum Mill and SEQUEST performed well in terms of sensitivity, but were inferior to MASCOT, X!Tandem, and Sonar in terms of specificity. Overall, MASCOT, a probabilistic search algorithm, correctly identified most peptides based on a specified FP rate. The rescoring algorithm, PeptideProphet, enhanced the overall performance of the SEQUEST algorithm, as well as provided predictable FP error rates. Ideally, score thresholds should be calculated for each peptide spectrum or minimally, derived from a reversed-sequence search as demonstrated in this study based on a validated data set. The availability of open-source search algorithms, such as X!Tandem, makes it feasible to further improve the validation process (manual or automatic) on the basis of ``consensus scoring'', i.e., the use of multiple (at least two) search algorithms to reduce the number of FPs.$\complement$},

  abstract = {MassBank is the first public repository of mass spectra of small chemical compounds for life sciences ($<$3000 Da). The database contains 605 electron-ionization mass spectrometry(EI-MS), 137 fast atom bombardment MS and 9276 electrospray ionization (ESI)-MSn data of 2337 authentic compounds of metabolites, 11 545 EI-MS and 834 other-MS data of 10 286 volatile natural and synthetic compounds, and 3045 ESI-MS2 data of 679 synthetic drugs contributed by 16 research groups (January 2010). ESI-MS2 data were analyzed under nonstandardized, independent experimental conditions. MassBank is a distributed database. Each research group provides data from its own MassBank data servers distributed on the Internet. MassBank users can access either all of the MassBank data or a subset of the data by specifying one or more experimental conditions. In a spectral search to retrieve mass spectra similar to a query mass spectrum, the similarity score is calculated by a weighted cosine correlation in which weighting exponents on peak intensity and the mass-to-charge ratio are optimized to the ESI-MS2 data. MassBank also provides a merged spectrum for each compound prepared by merging the analyzed ESI-MS2 data on an identical compound under different collision-induced dissociation conditions. Data merging has significantly improved the precision of the identification of a chemical compound by 21\textendash{}23\% at a similarity score of 0.6. Thus, MassBank is useful for the identification of chemical compounds and the publication of experimental data. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Application of this technology as a new type of biochemical lipid microscopy may lead to new discoveries of the lipid metabolism and biomarkers associated with area-specific alterations or damage under stress/disease conditions such as traumatic brain injury or acute lung injury, among others. However there are limitations in the range of what it can detect as compared with liquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS) of a lipid extract from a tissue section. The goal of the current work was to critically consider remarkable new opportunities along with the limitations and approaches for further improvements of MALDI-MSI. Based on our experimental data and assessments, improvements of the spectral and spatial resolution, sensitivity and specificity towards low abundance species of lipids are proposed. This is followed by a review of the current literature, including methodologies that other laboratories have used to overcome these challenges.},

While the computational tools currently available such as XCMS statistically assess and rank LC?MS features, they do not provide information about their structural identity. XCMS2 is an open source software package which has been developed to automatically search tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data against high quality experimental MS/MS data from known metabolites contained in a reference library (METLIN). Scoring of hits is based on a ?shared peak count? method that identifies masses of fragment ions shared between the analytical and reference MS/MS spectra. Another functional component of XCMS2 is the capability of providing structural information for unknown metabolites, which are not in the METLIN database. This ?similarity search? algorithm has been developed to detect possible structural motifs in the unknown metabolite which may produce characteristic fragment ions and neutral losses to related reference compounds contained in METLIN, even if the precursor masses are not the same.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0007710},
  abstract = {Background
Biochemical pathways provide an essential context for understanding comprehensive experimental data and the systematic workings of a cell. Therefore, the availability of online pathway browsers will facilitate post-genomic research, just as genome browsers have contributed to genomics. Many pathway maps have been provided online as part of public pathway databases. Most of these maps, however, function as the gateway interface to a specific database, and the comprehensiveness of their represented entities, data mapping capabilities, and user interfaces are not always sufficient for generic usage.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We have identified five central requirements for a pathway browser: (1) availability of large integrated maps showing genes, enzymes, and metabolites; (2) comprehensive search features and data access; (3) data mapping for transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic experiments, as well as the ability to edit and annotate pathway maps; (4) easy exchange of pathway data; and (5) intuitive user experience without the requirement for installation and regular maintenance. According to these requirements, we have evaluated existing pathway databases and tools and implemented a web-based pathway browser named Pathway Projector as a solution.

Conclusions/Significance
Pathway Projector provides integrated pathway maps that are based upon the KEGG Atlas, with the addition of nodes for genes and enzymes, and is implemented as a scalable, zoomable map utilizing the Google Maps API. Users can search pathway-related data using keywords, molecular weights, nucleotide sequences, and amino acid sequences, or as possible routes between compounds. In addition, experimental data from transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses can be readily mapped. Pathway Projector is freely available for academic users at http://www.g-language.org/PathwayProjector/.},

We demonstrated that methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) extraction allows faster and cleaner lipid recovery and is well suited for automated shotgun profiling. Because of MTBE's low density, lipid-containing organic phase forms the upper layer during phase separation, which simplifies its collection and minimizes dripping losses. Nonextractable matrix forms a dense pellet at the bottom of the extraction tube and is easily removed by centrifugation. Rigorous testing demonstrated that the MTBE protocol delivers similar or better recoveries of species of most all major lipid classes compared with the ``gold-standard'' Folch or Bligh and Dyer recipes.},

Cardinal supports both MALDI and DESI-based IMS workflows, and experiments with multiple tissues and complex designs. The main analytical functionalities include (1) image segmentation, which partitions a tissue into regions of homogeneous chemical composition, selects the number of segments and the subset of informative ions, and characterizes the associated uncertainty, and (2) image classification, which assigns locations on the tissue to pre-defined classes, selects the subset of informative ions, and estimates the resulting classification error by (cross-) validation. The statistical methods are based on mixture modeling and regularization.

Lipidome data were then analyzed using wavelet transform-principal component analysis (WT-PCA). Results revealed that phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylinositols (PIs), and phosphatidic acids (PAs) were biomarkers for discriminating SC from SCF, SCP, and SCA, respectively. PIs were believed to be extraordinarily important in all inhibitor-tolerant processes because they were the biomarkers responsible for the discrimination of all four different strains. Further analysis of the distribution of different hydrocarbon chains revealed that both the saturation and the length of the chains helped in maintaining proper fluidity of membranes.},

  abstract = {Data mining has been used intensively and extensively by many organizations. In healthcare, data mining is becoming increasingly popular, if not increasingly essential. Data mining applications can greatly benefit all parties involved in the healthcare industry. For example, data mining can help healthcare insurers detect fraud and abuse, healthcare organizations make customer relationship management decisions, physicians identify effective treatments and best practices, and patients receive better and more affordable healthcare services. The huge amounts of data generated by healthcare transactions are too complex and voluminous to be processed and analyzed by traditional methods. Data mining provides the methodology and technology to transform these mounds of data into useful information for decision making. This article explores data mining applications in healthcare. In particular, it discusses data mining and its applications within healthcare in major areas such as the evaluation of treatment effectiveness, management of healthcare, customer relationship management, and the detection of fraud and abuse. It also gives an illustrative example of a healthcare data mining application involving the identification of risk factors associated with the onset of diabetes. Finally, the article highlights the limitations of data mining and discusses some future directions.},

The case study highlights the need for an extended CRISP-DM approach when modeling clinical systems applying data mining (DM) and temporal abstraction (TA). As the number of such integrated TA/DM systems continues to grow, this limitation becomes significant and motivated our proposal of an extended CRISP-DM methodology to support TDM, known as CRISP-TDM. This approach supports clinical investigations on multi-dimensional time series data. This research paper has three key objectives: 1) Present a summary of the extended CRISP-TDM methodology; 2) Demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model to the NICU data, focusing on the challenges associated with multi-dimensional time series data; and 3) Describe the proposed IDA architecture for applying integrated TDM.},

Advances made in proteomics and mass spectrometry have resulted in considerable amount of data that cannot be easily visualized or interpreted. Mass spectral proteomic datasets are typically high dimensional but with small sample size. Consequently, advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used for knowledge discovery from such datasets. Their overall goal is to extract useful information that leads to the identification of protein biomarker candidates. Such biomarkers could potentially have diagnostic value as tools for early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of many diseases. The purpose of this review is to focus on the current trends in mining mass spectral proteomic data. Special emphasis is placed on the critical steps involved in the analysis of surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry proteomic data. Examples are drawn from previously published studies and relevant data mining terminology and techniques are exlained.},

  abstract = {Biomarkers are proteins or other components of a clinical sample whose measured intensity alters in response to a biological change such as an infection or disease, and which may therefore be useful for prediction and diagnosis. Proteomics is the science of discovering, identifying and understanding such components using tools such as mass spectrometry. In this paper we aim to provide a concise overview of designing and conducting an MS proteomics study in such a way as to allow statistical analysis that may lead to the discovery of novel markers. We provide a summary of the various stages that make up such an experiment, highlighting the need for experimental goals to be decided upon in advance. We discuss issues in experimental design at the sample collection stage, and good practice for standardising protocols within the proteomics laboratory. We then describe approaches to the data mining stage of the experiment, including the processing steps that transform a raw mass spectrum into a useable form. We propose a permutation-based procedure for determining the significance of reported error rates. Finally, because of its advantage in speed and low cost, we suggest that MS proteomics may be a good candidate for an early primary screening approach to disease diagnosis, identifying areas of risk and making referrals for more specific tests without necessarily making a diagnosis in its own right. Our discussion is illustrated with examples drawn from experiments on bovine blood serum designed to pinpoint novel biomarkers for bovine tuberculosis.},

Such ``exemplars'' can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called ``affinity propagation,'' which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

  abstract = {A method for identifying clusters of points in a multidimensional Euclidean space is described and its application to taxonomy considered. It reconciles, in a sense, two different approaches to the investigation of the spatial relationships between the points, viz., the agglomerative and the divisive methods. A graph, the shortest dendrite of Florek etal. (1951a), is constructed on a nearest neighbour basis and then divided into clusters by applying the criterion of minimum within cluster sum of squares. This procedure ensures an effective reduction of the number of possible splits. The method may be applied to a dichotomous division, but is perfectly suitable also for a global division into any number of clusters. An informal indicator of the "best number" of clusters is suggested. It is a"variance ratio criterion" giving some insight into the structure of the points. The method is illustrated by three examples, one of which is original. The results obtained by the dendrite method are compared with those obtained by using the agglomerative method or Ward (1963) and the divisive method of Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza (1965).},

However, there is little systematic guidance associated with these methods for solving important practical questions that arise in cluster analysis, such as how many clusters are there, which clustering method should be used, and how should outliers be handled. We review a general methodology for model-based clustering that provides a principled statistical approach to these issues. We also show that this can be useful for other problems in multivariate analysis, such as discriminant analysis and multivariate density estimation. We give examples from medical diagnosis, minefield detection, cluster recovery from noisy data, and spatial density estimation. Finally, we mention limitations of the methodology and discuss recent developments in model-based clustering for non-Gaussian data, high-dimensional datasets, large datasets, and Bayesian estimation.},

The simulation results for the stopping rules revealed a wide range in their ability to determine the correct number of clusters in the data. Several procedures worked fairly well, whereas others performed rather poorly. Thus, the latter group of rules would appear to have little validity, particularly for data sets containing distinct clusters.

The origin of this oxidative stress was not immediately apparent; however, there was a strong suggestion that it might be related to a fall in NADPH levels linked to a reduction in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, resulting in reduced levels of some metabolites in the pentose phosphate pathway. In addition to producing oxidative stress there were marked effects on tryptophan metabolism with most of the metabolites in the kynurenine pathway being lowered by allopurinol treatment. The effects on the kynurenine pathway could be related to the established use of allopurinol in treating schizophrenia.},

Modeling diet-induced obesity in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies), we elucidated transcriptional and metabolic changes in w (1118) flies on a high-fat diet (HFD). Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics revealed altered fatty acid, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism with HFD. Microarray analysis uncovered transcriptional changes in nitrogen metabolism, including CG9510, homolog of human argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). CG9510 knockdown in flies phenocopied traits observed with HFD, namely increased triglyceride levels and decreased cold tolerance. Restoration of CG9510 expression ameliorated observed negative consequences of HFD. Metabolomic analysis of CG9510 knockdown flies confirmed functional similarity to ASL, regulating the balance of carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In summary, we found that HFD suppresses CG9510 expression, a gene required for proper triglyceride storage and stress tolerance. These results draw an important link between regulation of amino acid metabolism and the response to diet-induced obesity.},

A constraint-based model of ATP-producing pathways was built using the annotated genome, existing models, and the literature. Multiple redundant pathways for producing acetate and alanine were added and simulations were run in order to find a single optimal strategy for producing each end product. System-wide adaptation to hypoxia was then investigated in silico using the refined model. Simulations supported the hypothesis that the ability to flexibly convert pyruvate to these three by-products might convey hypoxia tolerance by improving the ATP/H+ ratio and efficiency of glucose utilization.},

Female flies contained much higher levels of methylated lysines and methylated arginine suggesting differences in histone metabolism. In addition, there were differences in the methylation of nucleosides, and Sadenosylmethionine metabolism. Differences in the methylome may relate to the requirement of compensation for the single X chromosome present in males since methylated histones inhibit gene transcription. Nucleoside phosphate levels were elevated in female flies which may relate to increased requirement for DNA biosynthesis for egg production. A series of acylated amino acids previously observed in Drosophila was further characterised and these metabolites were present to a much greater extent in female flies and may be associated with the microbiome.},

  abstract = {Founding isofemale lines from wild collected females is a basic tool for investigating the genetic architecture of Drosophila natural populations. The method permits the analysis of quantitative traits under laboratory conditions, with a much broader scope than the mere evidence of a significant genetic heterogeneity among lines. Genetic variability is generally demonstrated by a significant coefficient of intraclass correlation, but several experimental precautions are needed and explained here. The relationship between classical (additive) heritability and intraclass correlation is not straightforward, presumably because the genetic bottlenecks due to the initiation of the lines unravel a significant, nonadditive genetic variance due to dominance and epistatic effects. It is thus suggested to consider intraclass correlation as a specific genetic parameter that enables comparisons between different traits, different populations or different environments. The use of isofemale lines is, however, not restricted to the calculation of an intraclass correlation. It can be used to estimate genetic correlations among traits or environments. The method is also convenient for the analysis of phenotypic plasticity in relation to an environmental gradient. A precise description of the response curves (the reaction norms) is possible, distinguishing trait parameters and plasticity parameters. A fairly general conclusion is that, for a given trait, mean value and plasticity are genetically independent. It is also possible to analyze traits, which, like sexual dimorphism, must be measured on different individuals, and even to demonstrate their genetic variability. In many cases, further empirical and theoretical analyses are possible and needed. It is argued that, in the future, isofemale lines will have an increasing significance among the various techniques appropriate to the analysis of quantitative evolutionary genetics in a diversity of species.},

  abstract = {Dietary restriction (DR) is a robust intervention that extends lifespan and slows the onset of age-related diseases in diverse organisms. While significant progress has been made in attempts to uncover the genetic mechanisms of DR, there are few studies on the effects of DR on the metabolome. In recent years, metabolomic profiling has emerged as a powerful technology to understand the molecular causes and consequences of natural aging and disease-associated phenotypes. Here, we use high-resolution mass spectroscopy and novel computational approaches to examine changes in the metabolome from the head, thorax, abdomen, and whole body at multiple ages in Drosophila fed either a nutrient-rich ad~libitum (AL) or nutrient-restricted (DR) diet. Multivariate analysis clearly separates the metabolome by diet in different tissues and different ages. DR significantly altered the metabolome and, in particular, slowed age-related changes in the metabolome. Interestingly, we observed interacting metabolites whose correlation coefficients, but not mean levels, differed significantly between AL and DR. The number and magnitude of positively correlated metabolites was greater under a DR diet. Furthermore, there was a decrease in positive metabolite correlations as flies aged on an AL diet. Conversely, DR enhanced these correlations with age. Metabolic set enrichment analysis identified several known (e.g., amino acid and NAD metabolism) and novel metabolic pathways that may affect how DR effects aging. Our results suggest that network structure of metabolites is altered upon DR and may play an important role in preventing the decline of homeostasis with age.},

  abstract = {In biological mass spectrometry, crude instrumental data need to be converted into meaningful theoretical models. Several data processing and data evaluation steps are required to come to the final results. These operations are often difficult to reproduce, because of too specific computing platforms. This effect, known as `workflow decay', can be diminished by using a standardized informatic infrastructure. Thus, we compiled an integrated platform, which contains ready-to-use tools and workflows for mass spectrometry data analysis. Apart from general unit operations, such as peak picking and identification of proteins and metabolites, we put a strong emphasis on the statistical validation of results and Data Mining. MASSyPup64 includes e.g., the OpenMS/TOPPAS framework, the Trans-Proteomic-Pipeline programs, the ProteoWizard tools, X!Tandem, Comet and SpiderMass. The statistical computing language R is installed with packages for MS data analyses, such as XCMS/metaXCMS and MetabR. The R package Rattle provides a user-friendly access to multiple Data Mining methods. Further, we added the non-conventional spreadsheet program teapot for editing large data sets and a command line tool for transposing large matrices. Individual programs, console commands and modules can be integrated using the Workflow Management System (WMS) taverna. We explain the useful combination of the tools by practical examples: (1) A workflow for protein identification and validation, with subsequent Association Analysis of peptides, (2) Cluster analysis and Data Mining in targeted Metabolomics, and (3) Raw data processing, Data Mining and identification of metabolites in untargeted Metabolomics. Association Analyses reveal relationships between variables across different sample sets. We present its application for finding co-occurring peptides, which can be used for target proteomics, the discovery of alternative biomarkers and protein\textendash{}protein interactions. Data Mining derived models displayed a higher robustness and accuracy for classifying sample groups in targeted Metabolomics than cluster analyses. Random Forest models do not only provide predictive models, which can be deployed for new data sets, but also the variable importance. We demonstrate that the later is especially useful for tracking down significant signals and affected pathways in untargeted Metabolomics. Thus, Random Forest modeling supports the unbiased search for relevant biological features in Metabolomics. Our results clearly manifest the importance of Data Mining methods to disclose non-obvious information in biological mass spectrometry . The application of a Workflow Management System and the integration of all required programs and data in a consistent platform makes the presented data analyses strategies reproducible for non-expert users. The simple remastering process and the Open Source licenses of MASSyPup64 (http://www. bioprocess.org/massypup/) enable the continuous improvement of the system.},

The chemical profiles of stem extracts from maize plants grown under low nitrogen (LN) or control trial (CT) were analyzed using optimized protocols for direct-injection electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DIESI-MS). Specific ions significantly decreased or increased because of environmental (LN versus CT) or genotypic effects. Biochemical profiling with DIESI-MS had a superior cost-benefit compared to other standard analytical technologies (e.g., ultraviolet, near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography with flame ionization detection) routinely used for plant breeding. The method can be successfully applied in maize, strawberry, coffee, and other crop species.},

To resolve the issues associated with having multiple formats, vendors, researchers, and software developers convened under the banner of the HUPO PSI to develop a single standard. The new data format incorporated many of the desirable technical attributes from the previous data formats, while adding a number of improvements, including features such as a controlled vocabulary with validation tools to ensure consistent usage of the format, improved support for selected reaction monitoring data, and immediately available implementations to facilitate rapid adoption by the community.

The method entails introduction of samples to the open air space between the DART ion source and the mass spectrometer inlet, with the entire observed mass spectral fingerprint subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering processing. A range of both polar and non-polar chemotypes are instantaneously detected. The result is identification and species level classification based on the entire DART-MS spectrum. Here, we illustrate how the method can be used to: (1) distinguish between endangered woods regulated by the Convention for the International Trade  of Endangered Flora and Fauna (CITES) treaty; (2) assess the origin and by extension the properties of biodiesel feedstocks; (3) determine insect species from analysis of puparial casings; (4) distinguish between psychoactive plants products; and (5) differentiate between Eucalyptus species. An advantage of the hierarchical clustering approach to processing of the DART-MS derived fingerprint is that it shows both similarities and differences between species based on their chemotypes. Furthermore, full knowledge of the identities of the constituents contained within the small molecule profile of analyzed samples is not required.},

New REST (REpresentational State Transfer) web services have been developed to serve the most popular functionality provided by BioMart (now discontinued due to data scalability issues) and address the data access requirements of the newly developed PRIDE Archive. Using the API (Application Programming Interface) it is  now possible to programmatically query for and retrieve peptide and protein identifications, project and assay metadata and the originally submitted files. Searching and filtering is also possible by metadata information, such as sample  details (e.g. species and tissues), instrumentation (mass spectrometer), keywords and other provided annotations. The PRIDE Archive web services were first made available in April 2014. The API has already been adopted by a few applications and standalone tools such as PeptideShaker, PRIDE Inspector, the Unipept web application and the Python-based BioServices package.

  abstract = {Many advanced metabolomics experiments currently lead to data where a large number of response variables were measured while one or several factors were changed. Often the number of response variables vastly exceeds the sample size and well-established techniques such as multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) cannot be used to analyze the data. ANOVA simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) is an alternative to MANOVA for analysis of metabolomics data from an experimental design. In this paper, we show that ASCA assumes that none of the metabolites are correlated and that they all have the same variance. Because of these assumptions, ASCA may relate the wrong variables to a factor. This reduces the power of the method and hampers interpretation. We propose an improved model that is essentially a weighted average of the ASCA and MANOVA models. The optimal weight is determined in a data-driven fashion. Compared to ASCA, this method assumes that variables can correlate, leading to a more realistic view of the data. Compared to MANOVA, the model is also applicable when the number of samples is (much) smaller than the number of variables. These advantages are demonstrated by means of simulated and real data examples.

  abstract = {A picosecond infrared laser (PIRL) is capable of cutting through biological tissues in the absence of significant thermal damage. As such, PIRL is a standalone surgical scalpel with the added bonus of minimal postoperative scar tissue formation. In this work, a tandem of PIRL ablation with electrospray ionization (PIR-LAESI) mass spectrometry is demonstrated and characterized for tissue molecular imaging, with a limit of detection in the range of 100 nM for reserpine or better than 5 nM for verapamil in aqueous solution. We characterized PIRL crater size using agar films containing Rhodamine. PIR-LAESI offers a 20?30 ?m vertical resolution (?3 ?m removal per pulse) and a lateral resolution of ?100 ?m. We were able to detect 25 fmol of Rhodamine in agar ablation experiments. PIR-LAESI was used to map the distribution of endogenous methoxykaempferol glucoronide in zebra plant (Aphelandra squarrosa) leaves producing a localization map that is corroborated by the literature. PIR-LAESI was further used to image the distribution inside mouse kidneys of gadoteridol, an exogenous magnetic resonance contrast agent intravenously injected. Parallel mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) using desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) were performed to corroborate PIR-LAESI images of the exogenous agent. We further show that PIR-LAESI is capable of desorption ionization of proteins as well as phospholipids. This comparative study illustrates that PIR-LAESI is an ion source for ambient mass spectrometry applications. As such, a future PIRL scalpel combined with secondary ionization such as ESI and mass spectrometry has the potential to provide molecular feedback to guide PIRL surgery.},

Thus, p-coumaroyl-N-tyrosine, caffeoyl-N-phenylalanine, caffeoyl-N-tyrosine, 3-dimethoxycinnamoyl-5-feruloylquinic acid, and dimethoxycinnamic acid were found to be characteristic markers for Ugandan Robusta green coffee beans. Multivariate data analysis of the phenolic and methylxanthine profiles provided preliminary results that allowed showing their potential for the determination of the geographical origin of green coffees. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) provided classification models that correctly identified all authentic Robusta green coffee beans from Cameroon and Vietnam and 94\% of those from Indonesia. Moreover, PLS-DA afforded independent models for Robusta samples from these three countries with sensitivities and specificities of classifications close to 100\% and for Arabica samples from America and Africa with sensitivities of 86 and 70\% and specificities to the other class of 90 and 97\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {The flavor and taste of coffee are the most important criteria for evaluating its quality and they are influenced by environmental as well as genetic factors. Because of these factors, including soil, climate and species, diverse components of coffee have been developed. To observe the variation of coffee components by region, a metabolomic approach was applied. In this study, 21 coffee samples of different origin were analyzed by various measuring devices. The acquired data was then integrated and processed by principal component analysis (PCA) using SAS 9.1 software. We found that we could successfully identify the origins of the coffee, dividing the samples in the regions of Asia, South America, and Africa, using the integrated metabolomic approach of combining diverse analytical data with multivariate analysis. In particular, the enhancement of subtle differences by combining data from several instruments resulted in the accurate discrimination of coffee origins.},

Comparative analyses of caffeine NMTs demonstrate that these genes expanded through sequential tandem duplications independently of genes from cacao and tea, suggesting that caffeine in eudicots is of polyphyletic origin.},

These bioactive components are responsible for the pharmacological properties of this auspicious plant and demonstrate its importance in daily intake and alimentation. Additionally, it is an excellent aid to digestion and also hydrolyzing gluten, which is an important aspect for dyspeptic and celiac disease patients. Papaya acts as an antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticarminative, anticancer, and has hepato-protective, immunological, and other therapeutic attributes. The seed and pulp of papaya have bacteriostatic effects against several enteropathogens, such as Bacillus subtilus and E. coli. In the current review, pharmacological attributes, nutritional value of papaya, and medicinal properties of its various parts have been elaborated to provide collective information on this multipurpose commercial plant. Moreover, its role in the production of alcohol and carboxymethyl cellulose is also the limelight of the article.

We tested for the presence of three other viruses because of the occurrence of severe, atypical symptoms in plantations. Only Papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) was detected. PRSV was present in every county. PapMV was less frequent, but its overall distribution was almost identical. PRSV and PapMV occurred in single or mixed infections of papaya and other host species that could function as virus reservoirs. We investigated the diversity of the coat protein (CP) sequences of 36 PRSV isolates. The amino acid sequence divergence among all isolates ranged from 0.4 to 9.9\%, and was comparable to that found in other regions of the world. In contrast to most of these world regions, there is a clear correlation between CP sequence variation and the geographical origins of the virus isolates.},

It is frequently used in biomarker identification and the metabolic profiling of cells, tissues or organisms. The data processing challenges in metabolomics are quite unique and often require specialized (or expensive) data analysis software and a detailed knowledge of cheminformatics, bioinformatics and statistics. In an effort to simplify metabolomic data analysis while at the same time improving user accessibility, we have developed a freely accessible, easy-to-use web server for metabolomic data analysis called MetaboAnalyst. Fundamentally, MetaboAnalyst is a web-based metabolomic data processing tool not unlike many of today's web-based microarray analysis packages. It accepts a variety of input data (NMR peak lists, binned spectra, MS peak lists, compound/concentration data) in a wide variety of formats. It also offers a number of options for metabolomic data processing, data normalization, multivariate statistical analysis, graphing, metabolite identification and pathway mapping. In particular, MetaboAnalyst supports such techniques as: fold change analysis, t-tests, PCA, PLS-DA, hierarchical clustering and a number of more sophisticated statistical or machine learning methods. It also employs a large library of reference spectra to facilitate compound identification from most kinds of input spectra. MetaboAnalyst guides users through a step-by-step analysis pipeline using a variety of menus, information hyperlinks and check boxes. Upon completion, the server generates a detailed report describing each method used, embedded with graphical and tabular outputs. MetaboAnalyst is capable of handling most kinds of metabolomic data and was designed to perform most of the common kinds of metabolomic data analyses. MetaboAnalyst is accessible at http://www.metaboanalyst.ca},

These datasets provide a window into dynamic biochemical networks and conjointly with other "omic" data, genes and proteins, have great potential to unravel complex human diseases. The dataset used in this study has 63 individuals, normal and diseased, and the diseased are drug treated or not, so there are three classes. The goal is to classify these individuals using the observed metabolite levels for 317 measured metabolites. There are a number of statistical challenges: non-normal data, the number of samples is less than the number of metabolites; there are missing data and the fact that data are missing is informative (assay values below detection limits can point to a specific class); also, there are high correlations among the metabolites. We investigate support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF), for outlier detection, variable selection and classification. We use the variables selected with RF in SVM and visa versa. The benefit of this study is insight into interplay of variable selection and classification methods. We link our selected predictors to the biochemistry of the disease.},

But these traits are complex and affected by many genes, each with small effect. Traditional marker-assisted selection has been ineffective for such traits. The introduction of genomic selection (GS), however, has shifted that paradigm. Rather than seeking to identify individual loci significantly associated with a trait, GS uses all marker data as predictors of performance and consequently delivers more accurate predictions. Selection can be based on GS predictions, potentially leading to more rapid and lower cost gains from breeding. The objectives of this article are to review essential aspects of GS and summarize the important take-home messages from recent theoretical, simulation and empirical studies. We then look forward and consider research needs surrounding methodological questions and the implications of GS for long-term selection.},

The book illuminates the inner world of Bolivar, the dynamics of his leadership, his power to command, and his modes of ruling the diverse peoples of Spanish America. The key to his greatness, Lynch concludes, was supreme will power and an ability to inspire people to follow him beyond their immediate interests, in some cases through years of unremitting struggle.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic selection or genome-wide selection (GS) has been highlighted as a new approach for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in recent years. GS is a form of MAS that selects favourable individuals based on genomic estimated breeding values. Previous studies have suggested the utility of GS, especially for capturing small-effect quantitative trait loci, but GS has not become a popular methodology in the field of plant breeding, possibly because there is insufficient information available on GS for practical use.
SCOPE: In this review, GS is discussed from a practical breeding viewpoint. Statistical approaches employed in GS are briefly described, before the recent progress in GS studies is surveyed. GS practices in plant breeding are then reviewed before future prospects are discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: Statistical concepts used in GS are discussed with genetic models and variance decomposition, heritability, breeding value and linear model. Recent progress in GS studies is reviewed with a focus on empirical studies. For the practice of GS in plant breeding, several specific points are discussed including linkage disequilibrium, feature of populations and genotyped markers and breeding scheme. Currently, GS is not perfect, but it is a potent, attractive and valuable approach for plant breeding. This method will be integrated into many practical breeding programmes in the near future with further advances and the maturing of its theory.},

  abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) is a staple crop used for subsistence by smallholder farmers around the world, who usually store grain for gradual use. During the course of storage, losses due to storage pests often reach 20\%. Over three cycles of recurrent selection, population improvement to develop sources of resistance to the larger grain borer (Prostephanus truncates) and the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) resulted in a new population called Population 84 (P84). The objective of this study was to evaluate the biophysical, phytochemical, and nutraceutical profile changes in P84 derived from three cycles of selection for resistance. Insect resistance parameters were evaluated using bioassay and biophysical, phytochemical, and nutraceutical parameters. Resistance to storage pests increased by two- to threefold after three cycles of selection for maize weevil and larger grain borer, respectively. The major factors related to enhanced resistance are kernel hardness (10\% increase) and proportion of pericarp (68\% increase) in the kernel. Comparing the phytochemical composition of the pericarp cell wall before and after selection revealed an elevated level of cell wall\textendash{}bound components (42\% increase), including ferulic and diferulic acids (14\% and twofold increase, respectively). Increases of 18\% in free phenolic acid were found in the endosperm. A significant association between insect resistance with antioxidant activity (r $>$ 0.75) establishes the possibility of seeking increased nutrients beneficial for human health in the same maize germplasm selected for increased insect resistance and stemming from the same compounds. Population 84 is a good source for resistance to postharvest pests with enhanced nutraceutical properties.},

MALDI MSI has been shown previously to be advantageous for imaging the distribution of a range of drugs and metabolites in whole body sections. Ion mobility separation (IMS) adds a further separation step to imaging experiments; demonstrated here is MALDI-IMS-MS whole body imaging of rats dosed at 6 mg/kg IV with an anticancer drug, vinblastine and shown is the distribution of the precursor ion m/z 811.4 and several product ions including m/z 793, 751, 733, 719, 691, 649, 524, and 355. The distribution of vinblastine within the ventricles of the brain is also depicted. Clearly demonstrated in these data are the removal of interfering isobaric ions within the images of m/z 811.4 and also of the transition m/z 811?751, resulting in a higher confidence in the imaging data. Within this work, IMS has shown to be advantageous in both MS and MS/MS imaging experiments by separating vinblastine from an endogenous isobaric lipid.},

  abstract = {KEY MESSAGE: A tropical RIL maize population was subjected to phenotypic and genotypic analysis for maize weevil resistance during four seasons, and three main genomic areas were detected as main QTLs. The maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) (MW) is a common and important pest of stored maize (Zea mays) worldwide, especially in tropical areas. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the MW have been analyzed previously in an F2 maize population. In this work, new germplasm-based F6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) families, derived from the cross of Population 84 and Kilima, were analyzed using insect bioassays during four seasons. The parameters analyzed for MW resistance were grain weight losses (GWL), adult progeny (AP), and flour production (FP). Composite interval mapping identified a total of 15 QTLs for MW parameters located on six chromosomes, explaining between 14 and 51 \% of phenotypic variation ($\sigma$ p (2) ) and 27 and 81 \% of genotypic variation ($\sigma$ g (2) ). The QTL obtained for GWL was located in bin 2.05, which explained 15 \% of $\sigma$ p (2) . For AP and FP, the QTLs were located on regions 1.09 and 2.05, explaining 7 and 15 \% of $\sigma$ p (2) , respectively. Comparative analysis between F2 and F6 families showed similarities in QTL localization; three main regions were co-localized in chromosomes 4.08, 10.04, and 10.07, where no resistance-associated genes have been reported previously. These regions could be used for a marker-assisted selection in breeding programs for MW resistance in tropical maize.},

These signals are generated at or close to the site of herbivore-inflicted injury and systemically move to target tissues where they induce defense responses. Chemical and physical signals depend on the connectivity of the plant body, whereas volatile compounds are released into the airspace. Different plants with different morphologies and ecological niches employ different modes of systemic signaling.},

We discovered that six of them exist as a cluster on chromosome 7, whereas an additional two are adjacent in a duplicated genomic region on chromosome 12. Following systematic functional analysis, we suggest a revised SGA biosynthetic pathway starting from cholesterol up to the tetrasaccharide moiety linked to the tomato SGA aglycone. Silencing GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM 4 prevented accumulation of SGAs in potato tubers and tomato fruit. This may provide a means for removal of unsafe, antinutritional substances present in these widely used food crops.},

  abstract = {The role of jasmonic acid (JA) on mycorrhizal colonization by Glomus fasciculatum in tomato plants was examined using mutant plants overexpressing prosystemin (PS) or affected in the synthesis of JA (suppressor of prosystemin-mediated responses 2, spr2). The degree of mycorrhizal colonization was determined by measuring frequency (F\%) and intensity (M\%) of colonization and arbuscule abundance (A\%). Gene expression and biochemical analyses were also performed in roots to detect changes in carbon (C) partitioning. Colonization was similar in mycorrhizal PS and wild-type roots, except for a higher A\% in the former. Conversely, colonization was severely reduced in roots of spr2 mutants. No association was found between levels of expression of genes coding for systemic wound responsive proteins (or SWRPs) and other defense-related proteins in roots and mycorrhization levels in these plants. On the other hand, the degree of mycorrhizal colonization correlated with changes in the transcriptional regulation of a number of genes involved in sucrose hydrolysis and transport, cell wall invertase activity and mycorrhizal-specific fatty acid content in roots. The results obtained suggest that one of the mechanisms by which JA might operate to modulate the mycorrhization process could be through its influence on the regulation of C partitioning in the plant. The significant colonization increase observed in mycorrhizal spr2 plants supplied with exogenous methyl jasmonate supports its role as a positive regulator of the symbiosis.},

During antagonism, elevated pathogenesis-related (PR-1) gene expression and increased reactive oxygen species production indicated the establishment of a host defense resulting in the reduction in PRSV titers. Polyribosomal fractioning showed that PRSV affects translation of cellular eEF1$\alpha$, PR-1, $\beta$-tubulin, and PapMV RNAs in planta, suggesting that its infection could be related to an imbalance in the translation machinery.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In order to obtain an initial and preliminary understanding of host and nonhost resistance in the initial step of potyvirus replication, both positive and negative Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) strands where traced in inoculated and systemic leaves in host and nonhost resistant maize and sugarcane for one Mexican potyviral isolate (SCMV-VER1). Intermediary replication forms, such as the negative viral strand, seem to only move a short distance as surveyed by RT-PCR analysis and ELISA in different leaves. Virus purification was also done in leaves and stems.
RESULTS: Susceptible maize plants allowed for viral SCMV replication, cell-to-cell, and long distance movement, as indicated by the presence of the coat protein along the plant. In the host resistant maize plants for the SCMV-VER1 isolate, the virus was able to establish the disease though the initial steps of virus replication, as detected by the presence of negative strands, in the basal area of the inoculated leaves at six and twelve days post inoculation. The nonhost sugarcane for SCMV-VER1 and the host sugarcane for SCMV-CAM6 also allowed the initial steps of viral replication for the VER1 isolate in the local inoculated leaf. SCMV-VER1 virions could be extracted from stems of susceptible maize with higher titers than leaves.
CONCLUSION: Nonhost and host resistance allow the initial steps of potyvirus SCMV replication, as shown by the negative strands' presence. Furthermore, both hosts allow the negative viral strands' local movement, but not their systemic spread through the stem. The presence of larger amounts of extractable virions from the stem (as compared to the leaves) in susceptible maize lines suggests their long distance movement as assembled particles. This will be the first report suggesting the long distance movement of a monocot potyvirus as a virion.},

The green coffee beans were contaminated at two different toxin levels (L1 = 5.3 $\mu$g kg-1 and L2 = 57.2 $\mu$g kg-1). Different roasting points (light, medium, dark and very dark) were set according to the L${_\ast}$ color coordinate.

The roasted beans were compared for their physical properties (bean swell and weight loss) as well as for their residual OTA content. The results indicated that the OTA reduction was similar for the two contamination levels: 95.1\% and 97.2\% with the rotating cylinder and 81.3\% and 79.2\% with the fluidized bed at the maximal roasting time. The OTA degradation kinetics differed between the two processes. The complete degradation of OTA within the limit of this study (230 $^\circ$C) was not observed but the rotating cylinder roasting was the most efficient technical process for the OTA reduction in a commercial dark roasted coffee (88\%).},

The effect of each post-harvest processing operation on the volatile fraction of the coffee produced was studied, particularly the effect of reducing the amount of water used in the process. The comparison of the green coffees from the different treatments revealed the importance of mucilage removal in distinguishing between the samples, and showed the merits of microbial mucilage removal in water to obtain coffees with a better aroma quality. These latter coffees were in fact characterised by pleasant and fruity aromatic notes, whereas those obtained after mechanical mucilage removal used in the ecological process were characterised by volatile compounds with an unpleasant note.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine how water and microbial stages in post-harvest processing affect the volatile content of coffee. Following our aroma analysis carried out on green coffees, we turned our attention to roasted coffees. Coffees produced by three variants of the wet method, and by an ecological process, were compared after roasting. Three degrees of roasting were applied to gain a clearer picture of the differences in roasted coffee aromas by means of a volatile compound analysis. Changes in the post-harvest process actually led to aroma differences in roasted coffees, and with light roasting it was possible to more effectively distinguish between the four treatments based on aroma criteria. Coffee produced by the traditional wet method, with microbial stages, had a better aroma quality than coffee produced by the ecological method, which was purely mechanical. Moreover, in the microbial method, mucilage removal under water gave coffees with more fruity, floral and caramel notes, whereas dry mucilage removal gave more neutral coffees. These results confirmed the importance of microbial mucilage removal under water and tallied with the results of our previous study on green coffee. This work provides coffee producers and roasters with an insight into the volatile composition of roasted coffee depending on the post-harvest process used and degree of roasting applied.},

  abstract = {The genome of the human intestinal parasite Entamoeba histolytica contains nearly 3000 introns and bioinformatic predictions indicate that major and minor spliceosomes occur in Entamoeba. However, except for the U2-, U4-, U5- and U6 snRNAs, no other splicing factor has been cloned and characterized. Here, we HA-tagged cloned the snRNP component U1A and assessed its expression and nuclear localization. Because the snRNP-free U1A form interacts with polyadenylate-binding protein, HA-U1A immunoprecipitates could identify early and late splicing complexes. Avoiding Entamoeba's endonucleases and ensuring the precipitation of RNA-binding proteins, parasite cultures were UV cross-linked prior to nuclear fraction immunoprecipitations with HA antibodies, and precipitates were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses. To discriminate their nuclear roles (chromatin-, co-transcriptional-, splicing-related), MS/MS analyses were carried out with proteins eluted with MS2-GST-sepharose from nuclear extracts of an MS2 aptamer-tagged Rabx13 intron amoeba transformant. Thus, we probed thirty-six Entamoeba proteins corresponding to 32 cognate splicing-specific factors, including 13 DExH/D helicases required for all stages of splicing, and 12 different splicing-related helicases were identified also. Furthermore 50 additional proteins, possibly involved in co-transcriptional processes were identified, revealing the complexity of co-transcriptional splicing in Entamoeba. Some of these later factors were not previously found in splicing complex analyses.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Numerous facts about the splicing of the nearly 3000 introns of the Entamoeba genome have not been unraveled, particularly the splicing factors and their activities. Considering that many of such introns are located in metabolic genes, the knowledge of the splicing cues has the potential to be used to attack or control the parasite. We have found numerous new splicing-related factors which could have therapeutic benefit. We also detected all the DExH/A RNA helicases involved in splicing and splicing proofreading control. Still, Entamoeba is very inefficient in splicing fidelity, thus we may have found a possible model system to study these processes.},

  abstract = {Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) has been used to generate ion images of samples in one or more mass-to-charge (m/z) values, providing the capability of mapping specific molecules to two-dimensional coordinates of the original sample. The high sensitivity of the technique (low-femtomole to attomole levels for proteins and peptides) allows the study of organized biochemical processes occurring in, for example, mammalian tissue sections. The mass spectrometer is used to determine the molecular weights of the molecular in the surface layers of the tissue. Molecules desorbed from the sample typically are singly protonated, giving an ion at (M + H)+, where M is the molecular mass. The procedure involves coating the tissue section, or a blotted imprint of the section, with a thin layer of energy-absorbing matrix and then analyzing the sample to produce an ordered array of mass spectra, each containing nominal m/z values typically covering a range of over 50,000 Da. Images can be displayed in individual m/z values as a selected ion image, which would localize individual compounds in the tissue, or as summed ion images. MALDI ion images of tissue sections can be obtained directly from tissue slices following preparative steps, and this is demonstrated for the mapping of insulin contained in an islet in a section of rat pancreas, hormone peptides in a small area of a section of rat pituitary, and a small protein bound to the membrane of human mucosa cells. Alternatively, imprints of the tissue can be analyzed by blotting the tissue sections on specially prepared targets containing an adsorbent material, e.g., C-18 coated resin beads. Peptides and small proteins bind to the C-18 and create a positive imprint of the tissue which can then be imaged by the mass spectrometer. This is demonstrated for the MALDI ion image analysis of regions of rat splenic pancreas and for an area of rat pituitary traversing the anterior, intermediate, and posterior regions where localized peptides were mapped. In a single spectrum from the anterior/intermediate lobe of a rat pituitary print, over 50 ions corresponding to the peptides present in this tissue were observed as well as precursors, isoforms, and metabolic fragments.},

Examples demonstrating localization of proteins in tumors, a reduction of lamellar phospholipids in the region binding two single celled organisms, and sub-cellular distributions of several biomolecules have all contributed to an increasing upsurge in interest in imaging mass spectrometry.

An advantage of this approach is that users do not have to share raw data along with analyses; instead, data is retrieved via OpenMSI's web API. The IPython notebook interface provides a low-barrier entry point for data manipulation that is accessible for scientists without extensive computational training. Via these notebooks, analyses can be easily shared without requiring any data movement. We provide example notebooks for several common MSI analysis types including data normalization, plotting, clustering, and classification, and image registration.},

The two lines of descent, nevertheless shared a common ancestor, that was far simpler than the procaryote.

Such a scenario recapitulates the ideas of J. B. S. Haldane sketched in his classic 1928 essay. However, unlike in Haldane's day, considerable support for this scenario exits today: lack of homology between core DNA replication system components in archaea and bacteria, distinct membrane chemistries and enzymes of lipid biosynthesis in archaea and bacteria, spread of several viral hallmark genes among diverse groups of viruses, and the extant archaeal and bacterial chromosomes appear to be shaped by accretion of diverse, smaller replicons. Under the viral model of precellular evolution, the key components of cells originated as components of virus-like entities. The two surviving types of cellular life forms, archaea and bacteria, might have emerged from the LUCAS independently, along with, probably, numerous forms now extinct.},

Many requirements for multicellular organization (cell adhesion, cell-cell communication and coordination, programmed cell death) likely evolved in ancestral unicellular organisms. However, the evolution of multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors may be opposed by genetic conflicts that arise when mutant cell lineages promote their own increase at the expense of the integrity of the multicellular organism. Numerous defenses limit such genetic conflicts, perhaps the most important being development from a unicell, which minimizes conflicts from selection among cell lineages, and redistributes genetic variation arising within multicellular individuals between individuals. With a unicellular bottleneck, defecting cell lineages rarely succeed beyond the life span of the multicellular individual. When multicellularity arises through aggregation of scattered cells or when multicellular organisms fuse to form genetic chimeras, there are more opportunities for propagation of defector cell lineages. Intraorganismal competition may partly explain why multicellular organisms that develop by aggregation generally exhibit less differentiation than organisms that develop clonally.},

  abstract = {The primary foundation for contemplating the possible forms of life elsewhere in the Universe is the evolutionary trends that have marked life on Earth. For its first three billion years, life on Earth was a world of microscopic forms, rarely achieving a size greater than a millimetre or a complexity beyond two or three cell types. But in the past 600 million years, the evolution of much larger and more complex organisms has transformed the biosphere. Despite their disparate forms and physiologies, the evolution and diversification of plants, animals, fungi and other macroforms has followed similar global trends. One of the most important features underlying evolutionary increases in animal and plant size, complexity and diversity has been their modular construction from reiterated parts. Although simple filamentous and spherical forms may evolve wherever cellular life exists, the evolution of motile, modular mega-organisms might not be a universal pattern.},

  abstract = {A theory of the origin of eukaryotic cells (``higher'' cells which divide by classical mitosis) is presented. By hypothesis, three fundamental organelles the mitochondria, the photosynthetic plastids and the (9+2) basal bodies of flagella were themselves once free-living (prokaryotic) cells. The evolution of photosynthesis under the anaerobic conditions of the early atmosphere to form anaerobic bacteria, photosynthetic bacteria and eventually blue-green algae (and protoplastids) is described. The subsequent evolution of aerobic metabolism in prokaryotes to form aerobic bacteria (protoflagella and protomitochondria) presumably occurred during the transition to the oxidizing atmosphere. Classical mitosis evolved in protozoan-type cells millions of years after the evolution of photosynthesis. A plausible scheme for the origin of classical mitosis in primitive amoeboflagellates is presented. During the course of the evolution of mitosis, photosynthetic plastids (themselves derived from prokaryotes) were symbiotically acquired by some of these protozoans to form the eukaryotic algae and the green plants. The cytological, biochemical and paleontological evidence for this theory is presented, along with suggestions for further possible experimental verification. The implications of this scheme for the systematics of the lower organisms is discussed.},

This is interpreted in economic terms as the consequence of a greater degree of cooperative division of labour within larger entities. The rate of increase of complexity with size is less in the case of a cooperative division of labour (cell types within bodies) than in the analogous case of a competitive division of labour (species within communities). This is atttributed to the inutility of single specialized cells whose goods must be shared among all the many cells of a large organism. Major groups of organisms differ in complexity at given size: animals are more complex than plants, and phaeophytes are simpler than either.},

After the workshop, a writing group produced a consensus statement which was reviewed and approved by all participants. Conclusions~ The IDF has produced a new set of criteria for use both epidemiologically and in clinical practice world-wide with the aim of identifying people with the MetS to clarify the nature of the syndrome and to focus therapeutic strategies to reduce the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease. Guidance is included on how to compensate for differences in waist circumference and in regional adipose tissue distribution between different populations. The IDF has also produced recommendations for additional criteria that should be included when studying the MetS for research purposes. Finally, the IDF has identified areas where more studies are currently needed; these include research into the aetiology of the syndrome.},

  abstract = {Resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is present in the majority of patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and in approximately 25\% of nonobese individuals with normal oral glucose tolerance. In these conditions, deterioration of glucose tolerance can only be prevented if the beta-cell is able to increase its insulin secretory response and maintain a state of chronic hyperinsulinemia. When this goal cannot be achieved, gross decompensation of glucose homeostasis occurs. The relationship between insulin resistance, plasma insulin level, and glucose intolerance is mediated to a significant degree by changes in ambient plasma free-fatty acid (FFA) concentration. Patients with NIDDM are also resistant to insulin suppression of plasma FFA concentration, but plasma FFA concentrations can be reduced by relatively small increments in insulin concentration. Consequently, elevations of circulating plasma FFA concentration can be prevented if large amounts of insulin can be secreted. If hyperinsulinemia cannot be maintained, plasma FFA concentration will not be suppressed normally, and the resulting increase in plasma FFA concentration will lead to increased hepatic glucose production. Because these events take place in individuals who are quite resistant to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, it is apparent that even small increases in hepatic glucose production are likely to lead to significant fasting hyperglycemia under these conditions. Although hyperinsulinemia may prevent frank decompensation of glucose homeostasis in insulin-resistant individuals, this compensatory response of the endocrine pancreas is not without its price. Patients with hypertension, treated or untreated, are insulin resistant, hyperglycemic, and hyperinsulinemic. In addition, a direct relationship between plasma insulin concentration and blood pressure has been noted. Hypertension can also be produced in normal rats when they are fed a fructose-enriched diet, an intervention that also leads to the development of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. The development of hypertension in normal rats by an experimental manipulation known to induce insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia provides further support for the view that the relationship between the three variables may be a causal one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The risk factors include raised blood pressure, dyslipidemia (raised triglycerides and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), raised fasting glucose, and central obesity. Various diagnostic criteria have been proposed by different organizations over the past decade. Most recently, these have come from the International Diabetes Federation and the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The main difference concerns the measure for central obesity, with this being an obligatory component in the International Diabetes Federation definition, lower than in the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria, and ethnic specific. The present article represents the outcome of a meeting between several major organizations in an attempt to unify criteria. It was agreed that there should not be an obligatory component, but that waist measurement would continue to be a useful preliminary screening tool. Three abnormal findings out of 5 would qualify a person for the metabolic syndrome. A single set of cut points would be used for all components except waist circumference, for which further work is required. In the interim, national or regional cut points for waist circumference can be used.},

METHODS Cardiovascular outcome was evaluated in 1,191 elderly treated hypertensive patients ($\geq$60 years). Among them, 578 (48.5\%) had MetS according to a modified joint interim statement definition (body mass index in place of waist circumference).
RESULTS During the follow-up (9.1$\pm$4.9 years, range 0.4\textendash{}20 years), 139 strokes and 120 coronary events occurred. In univariate analysis, patients with MetS had higher risk of the composite endpoint (hazard ratio (HR) 1.322, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.035\textendash{}1.688, P $<$ 0.05). Among the single components of MetS, only blood pressure (BP) level and impaired fasting glucose/diabetes were significantly associated with increased cardiovascular risk. After adjustment for age, previous events, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and left atrial (LA) enlargement, the prognostic relevance of MetS was attenuated (HR 1.245, 95\% CI 0.974\textendash{}1.591, P = 0.08). After further adjustment for the above-mentioned variables and ambulatory BP parameters and impaired fasting glucose/diabetes, Cox regression analysis showed that MetS was not independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk (HR 1.090, 95\% CI 0.805\textendash{}1.475, P = 0.58).
CONCLUSIONS In elderly treated hypertensive patients, MetS is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but not independently of BP and glucose levels and of organ damage.},

Methods: We analysed data on body mass index, blood pressure and plasma levels of glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides from seven European cohorts comprising 564 596 men and women with a mean age of 44 years. We weighted those factors equally into a standardized metabolic risk score [MRS, mean = 0, standard deviation (SD) = 1], with an individual's level indicated as SDs from the sex- and cohort-specific means. Cancer hazard ratios were calculated by Cox regression with age as timescale and with relevant adjustments including smoking status. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: During a mean follow-up of 12 years, 21 593 men and 14 348 women were diagnosed with cancer. MRS was linearly and positively associated with incident cancer in total and at sites (P $<$ 0.05). In men, risk per SD MRS was increased by 43\% (95\% confidence interval: 27\textendash{}61) for renal cell cancer, 43\% (16\textendash{}76) for liver cancer, 29\% (20\textendash{}38) for colon cancer, 27\% (5\textendash{}54) for oesophageal cancer, 20\% (9\textendash{}31) for rectal cancer, 19\% (4\textendash{}37) for leukaemias, 15\% (1\textendash{}30) for oral cancer and 10\% (2\textendash{}19) for bladder cancer. In women, risk increases per SD MRS were 56\% (42\textendash{}70) for endometrial cancer, 53\% (29\textendash{}81) for pancreatic cancer, 40\% (16\textendash{}67) for renal cell cancer, 27\% (9\textendash{}47) for cervical cancer and 17\% (3\textendash{}32) for rectal cancer.
Conclusion: This largest study to date on the joint influence of metabolic factors on risk of separate cancers showed increased risks for several cancers, in particular renal cell and liver cancer in men and endometrial and pancreatic cancer in women.},

In persons with MetS but without diabetes, risks of CHD and CVD mortality remained elevated. Diabetes predicted all mortality end points. Those with even 1 to 2 MetS risk factors were at increased risk for mortality from CHD and CVD. Moreover, MetS more strongly predicts CHD, CVD, and total mortality than its individual components.

  abstract = {Context and Objective: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been shown to predict mortality in the middle-aged, but less is known on the impact of MetS and its components on mortality risk in the elderly. Our objectives were 1) to examine the association of MetS with the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a French elderly community-dweller cohort and 2) to determine the main components driving these associations., Participants and Methods: Prospective analyses were carried out on 7118 men and women aged 65 yr and over from the Three-City cohort. Association between MetS (defined using the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) and mortality risk over the 7-yr follow-up was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models., Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, health behaviors, and health status, a 50\% increased risk for all-cause mortality was observed in participants with MetS at baseline compared with those without, with a hazard ratio of 1.54 [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.24\textendash{}1.92]. Elevated fasting blood glucose, high triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were the major contributors to this association, acting synergistically on mortality risk. For coronary heart disease mortality and cancer mortality, the hazard ratios associated with MetS were 2.21 (95\% CI = 1.07\textendash{}4.55) and 1.49 (95\% CI = 1.04\textendash{}2.14), respectively., Conclusions: By showing that an elevated fasting blood glucose potentiates the excess mortality risk associated with lipid abnormality, our study supports the status of MetS as a risk factor for mortality in the elderly. Our findings emphasize the importance of MetS screening and managing dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia in older persons in general practice., Fasting blood glucose-component potentiates the excess mortality risk associated with lipid abnormality, suggesting a causal impact of the multi-component metabolic syndrome on mortality in the elderly.},

Age-related eye diseases, the leading cause of blindness globally and visual impairment in developed countries, are also on the rise due to aging of the population. Many of the individual components of the metabolic syndrome have been shown to be associated with these eye diseases. However, the association of metabolic syndrome with eye diseases is not clear. In this review, we reviewed the evidence for associations between metabolic syndrome and certain ocular diseases in populations. We also reviewed the association of individual metabolic syndrome components with ocular diseases due to a paucity of research in this area. Besides, we also summarised the current understanding of etiological mechanisms of how metabolic syndrome or the individual components lead to these ocular diseases. With increasing evidence of such associations, it may be important to identify patients who are at risk of developing metabolic syndrome as prompt treatment and intervention may potentially decrease the risk of developing certain ocular diseases.},

  abstract = {Diabetes is a disease characterized by a relative or absolute lack of insulin, leading to hyperglycaemia. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is due to an autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, and type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance coupled by a failure of the beta cell to compensate. Animal models for type 1 diabetes range from animals with spontaneously developing autoimmune diabetes to chemical ablation of the pancreatic beta cells. Type 2 diabetes is modelled in both obese and non-obese animal models with varying degrees of insulin resistance and beta cell failure. This review outlines some of the models currently used in diabetes research. In addition, the use of transgenic and knock-out mouse models is discussed. Ideally, more than one animal model should be used to represent the diversity seen in human diabetic patients.},

This lifestyle often leads to energy imbalance, obesity, diabetes and their associated metabolic disorders, including cardiovascular diseases. It has become increasingly recognized that obesity and cardiovascular disease are metabolically linked, and a better understanding of this relationship requires that we uncover the fundamental genetic mechanisms controlling obesity-related heart dysfunction, a goal that has been difficult to achieve in higher organisms with intricate metabolic complexity. However, the high degree of evolutionary conservation of genes and signalling pathways allows researchers to use lower animal models such as Drosophila, which is the simplest genetic model with a heart, to uncover the mechanistic basis of obesity-related heart disease and its likely relevance to humans. Here, we discuss recent advances made by using the power of the Drosophila as a powerful model to investigate the genetic pathways by which a high fat diet may lead to heart dysfunction.},

Our analysis identified 714 distinct human disease genes (77\% of disease genes searched) matching 548 unique Drosophila sequences, which we have summarized by disease category. This breakdown into disease classes creates a picture of disease genes that are amenable to study usingDrosophila as the model organism. Of the 548Drosophila genes related to human disease genes, 153 are associated with known mutant alleles and 56 more are tagged byP-element insertions in or near the gene. Examples of how to use the database to identify Drosophila genes related to human disease genes are presented. We anticipate that cross-genomic analysis of human disease genes using the power of Drosophilasecond-site modifier screens will promote interaction between human andDrosophila research groups, accelerating the understanding of the pathogenesis of human genetic disease.

  abstract = {The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is increasingly utilized as an alternative to costly rodent models to study human diseases. Fly models exist for a wide variety of human conditions, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease, or cardiac function. Advantages of the fly system are its rapid generation time and its low cost. However, the greatest strength of the fly system are the powerful genetic tools that allow for rapid dissection of molecular disease mechanisms. Here, we describe the diet-dependent development of metabolic phenotypes in adult fruit flies. Depending on the specific type of nutrient, as well as its relative quantity in the diet, flies show weight gain and changes in the levels of storage macromolecules. Furthermore, the activity of insulin-signaling in the major metabolic organ of the fly, the fat body, decreases upon overfeeding. This decrease in insulin-signaling activity in overfed flies is moreover observed when flies are challenged with an acute food stimulus, suggesting that overfeeding leads to insulin resistance. Similar changes were observed in aging flies, with the development of the insulin resistance-like phenotype beginning at early middle ages. Taken together, these data demonstrate that imbalanced diet disrupts metabolic homeostasis in adult D. melanogaster and promotes insulin-resistant phenotypes. Therefore, the fly system may be a useful alternative tool in the investigation of molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance and the development of pharmacologic treatment options.},

  abstract = {While large populations in the third world are enduring famine, much of the developed world is undergoing an obesity epidemic. In addition to reflecting an unbalanced distribution of food, the "epidemic of overabundance" is ironically leading to a decrease in the health and longevity of the obese and improperly nourished in the first world. International consortia, such as the European Nutrigenomics Organization (NuGO), are increasing our knowledge of nutrientgene interactions and the effects of diet and obesity on human health. In this review, we summarize both previous and ongoing nutrigenomics studies in Drosophila and we explain how these studies can be used to provide insights into molecular mechanisms underlying nutrigenomics in humans. We will discuss how quantitative trait locus (QTL) experiments have identified genes that affect triglyceride levels in Drosophila, and how microarray analyses show that hundreds of genes have altered gene expression under different dietary conditions. Finally, we will discuss ongoing combined microarray-QTL studies, termed "genetical genomics," that promise to identify "master modulatory loci" that regulate global responses of potentially hundreds of genes under different dietary conditions. When "master modulatory loci" are identified in Drosophila, then experiments in mammalian models can be used to determine the relevance of these genes to human nutrition and health.},

Well-known developmental genes are often reused in surprising tissues in the adult, suggesting new functions. The homologs of many human genetic disease loci show selective expression in the Drosophila tissues analogous to the affected human tissues, providing a useful filter for potential candidate genes.

Here, we report, for the first time in Drosophila, a rapid, easy, and highly specific method for modifying the Drosophila genome at a very high efficiency by means of an improved transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) strategy. We took advantage of the very recently developed ``unit assembly'' strategy to assemble two pairs of specific TALENs designed to modify the yellow gene (on the sex chromosome) and a novel autosomal gene. The mRNAs of TALENs were subsequently injected into Drosophila embryos. From 31.2\% of the injected F0 fertile flies, we detected inheritable modification involving the yellow gene. The entire process from construction of specific TALENs to detection of inheritable modifications can be accomplished within one month. The potential applications of this TALEN-mediated genome modification method in Drosophila are discussed.},

Intramolecular recombination in S2 cells on transfected plasmid DNA carrying the attB and attP recognition sites occurred at a frequency of 47\%. In addition, several endogenous pseudo attP sites were identified in the fly genome that were recognized by the integrase and used as substrates for integration in S2 cells. Two lines of Drosophila were created by integrating an attP site into the genome with a P element. $\varphi$C31 integrase injected into embryos as mRNA functioned to promote integration of an attB-containing plasmid into the attP site, resulting in up to 55\% of fertile adults producing transgenic offspring. A total of 100\% of these progeny carried a precise integration event at the genomic attP site. These experiments demonstrate the potential for precise genetic engineering of the Drosophila genome with the $\varphi$C31 integrase system and will likely benefit research in Drosophila and other insects.},

This species includes four genetically isolated cactus host races each individually specializing on the necrotic tissues of a different cactus species. The necrosis of each cactus species provides the resident D. mojavensis populations with a distinct chemical environment. A previous investigation of the role of transcriptional variation in the adaptation of D. mojavensis to its hosts produced a set of candidate loci that are differentially expressed in response to host shifts, and among them was glutathione S-transferase D1 (GstD1). In both D. melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, GstD1 has been implicated in the resistance of these species to the insecticide dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT). The pattern of sequence variation of the GstD1 locus from all four D. mojavensis populations, D. arizonae (sister species), and D. navojoa (outgroup) has been examined. The data suggest that in two populations of D. mojavensis GstD1 has gone through a period of adaptive amino acid evolution. Further analyses indicate that of the seven amino acid fixations that occurred in the D. mojavensis lineage, two of them occur in the active site pocket, potentially having a significant effect on substrate specificity and in the adaptation to alternative cactus hosts.},

Rigorous studies of the relationships between host races of D. mojavensis and the relationships among the members of the species group (D. mojavensis, Drosophila arizona, and Drosophila navojoa) are lacking. We used mitochondrial CO1 sequence data to address the phylogenetics and population genetics of this species group. In this study we have found that the sister species D. mojavensis and D. arizonae share no mitochondrial haplotypes and thus show no evidence for recent introgression. We estimate the divergence time between D. mojavensis and D. arizonae to be between 1.91 and 2.97 million years ago. D. arizonae shows little structure in our population genetic analyses but there is phylogenetic differentiation between southeastern and northern populations of D. arizonae. Drosophila mojavensis shows significant population and phylogenetic structure across the four geographic regions of its distribution. The mitochondrial data support an origin of D. mojavensis on the mainland with early differentiation into the populations now found in the Mojave Desert and the Mainland Sonoran Desert and later colonization of the Baja Peninsula, in contrast to previous models. Also, the sister clade to D. mojavensis/D. arizonae includes D. navojoa and Drosophila huaylasi. By defining the genetic relationships among these populations, we provide a foundation for more sophisticated hypothesis testing regarding the timing of early speciation events and host switches in this species group.},

This species pair can produce fertile hybrids in some crosses and are sympatric in a large part of their ranges. Despite the potential for hybridization in nature, however, evidence of introgression has not been rigorously sought. Further, the evolutionary relationships within and among the geographically distant populations of the two species have not been characterized in detail using high-resolution molecular studies. Both species have six chromosomes: five large acrocentrics and one 'dot' chromosome. Fixed inversion differences between the species exist in three chromosomes (X, 2 and 3) while three are colinear (4, 5 and 6), suggesting that were introgression to occur, it would be most likely in the colinear chromosomes. We utilized nucleotide sequence variation at multiple loci on five chromosomes to test for evidence of introgression, and to test various scenarios for the evolutionary relationships of these two species and their populations. While we do not find evidence of recent introgression, loci in the colinear chromosomes appear to have participated in exchange in the past. We also found considerable population structure within both species. The level of differentiation discovered among D. arizonae populations was unexpectedly high and suggests that its populations, as well as those of D. mojavensis, may be themselves undergoing incipient speciation and merit further attention.},

We located chromosomal regions that were inverted between these species and analyzed those regions independently of others.

Further tests using average nucleotide differences between species and phylogenetic analyses also failed to find support for introgression between D. mojavensis and D. arizonae.

The midway gene encodes a protein similar to mammalian acyl coenzyme A: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), which converts diacylglycerol (DAG) into triacylglycerol (TAG). midway mutant egg chambers contain severely reduced levels of neutral lipids in the germline. Expression of midway in insect cells results in high levels of DGAT activity in vitro. These results show that midway encodes a functional DGAT and that changes in acylglycerol lipid metabolism disrupt normal egg chamber development in Drosophila.},

Loss of lipin 1 in the mouse, but not in humans, leads to lipodystrophy and fatty liver disease. Here we show that the single lipin orthologue of Drosophila melanogaster (dLipin) is essential for normal adipose tissue (fat body) development and TAG storage. dLipin mutants are characterized by reductions in larval fat body mass, whole-animal TAG content, and lipid droplet size. Individual cells of the underdeveloped fat body are characterized by increased size and ultrastructural defects affecting cell nuclei, mitochondria, and autophagosomes. Under starvation conditions, dLipin is transcriptionally upregulated and functions to promote survival. Together, these data show that dLipin is a central player in lipid and energy metabolism, and they establish Drosophila as a genetic model for further studies of conserved functions of the lipin family of metabolic regulators.},

Despite their opposite phenotypes, these two conditions both cause ectopic lipid storage in non-adipose tissues, leading to lipotoxicity, which has health-threatening consequences. The exact mechanisms underlying ectopic lipid storage remain elusive. Here we report the analysis of a Drosophila model of the most severe form of human lipodystrophy, Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy 2, which is caused by mutations in the BSCL2/Seipin gene. In addition to reduced lipid storage in the fat body, dSeipin mutant flies accumulate ectopic lipid droplets in the salivary gland, a non-adipose tissue. This phenotype was suppressed by expressing dSeipin specifically within the salivary gland. dSeipin mutants display synergistic genetic interactions with lipogenic genes in the formation of ectopic lipid droplets. Our data suggest that dSeipin may participate in phosphatidic acid metabolism and subsequently down-regulate lipogenesis to prevent ectopic lipid droplet formation. In summary, we have demonstrated a tissue-autonomous role of dSeipin in ectopic lipid storage in lipodystrophy.},

  issn = {0892-6638, 1530-6860},
  abstract = {Sphingolipids have been implicated in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and programmed cell death. The current paradigm for their action is that complex sphingolipids such as gangliosides interact with growth factor receptors, the extracellular matrix, and neighboring cells, whereas the backbones--sphingosine and other long-chain or "sphingoid" bases, ceramides, and sphingosine 1-phosphate--activate or inhibit protein kinases and phosphatases, ion transporters, and other regulatory machinery. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 1beta, and nerve growth factor, for example, induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide. Other agonists, such as platelet-derived growth factor, trigger further hydrolysis of ceramide to sphingosine and activate sphingosine kinase to form sphingosine 1-phosphate. These metabolites either stimulate or inhibit growth and may be cytotoxic (in some cases via induction of apoptosis), depending on which products are formed (or added exogenously), the cellular levels (and possibly intracellular localization), and the cell type. In Swiss 3T3 cells, for example, sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate are growth stimulatory at low concentrations via calcium mobilization from intracellular stores and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway and transcription factors (AP-1), but are toxic at high concentrations. High levels of endogenous sphingoid bases are also produced by inhibition of ceramide synthase by fumonisins, mycotoxins produced by Fusarium moniliforme, resulting in growth stimulation or toxicity. Thus, sphingolipid metabolites appear to serve as second messengers for growth factors, cytokines, and other "physiological" agonists and, when elevated abnormally, to lead to disease.},

  abstract = {The last 10 years have seen a rebirth of interest in lipid biology in the fields of Drosophila development and neurobiology, and sphingolipids have emerged as controlling many processes that have not previously been studied from the viewpoint of lipid biochemistry. Mutations in sphingolipid regulatory enzymes have been pinpointed as affecting cell survival and growth in tissues ranging from muscle to retina. Specification of cell types are also influenced by sphingolipid regulatory pathways, as genetic interactions of glycosphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes with many well-known signaling receptors such as Notch and epidermal growth factor receptor reveal. Furthermore, studies in flies are now uncovering unexpected roles of sphingolipids in controlling lipid storage and response to nutrient availability. The sophisticated genetics of Drosophila is particularly well suited to uncover the roles of sphingolipid regulatory enzymes in development and metabolism, especially in light of conserved pathways that are present in both flies and mammals. The challenges that remain in the field of sphingolipid biology in Drosophila are to combine traditional developmental genetics with more analytical biochemical and biophysical methods, to quantify and localize the responses of these lipids to genetic and metabolic perturbations.},

The link from genomes to pathways is made through the KEGG Orthology system, a collection of manually defined ortholog groups identified by K numbers. To better automate this interpretation process the KEGG modules defined by Boolean expressions of K numbers have been expanded and improved. Once genes in a genome are annotated with K numbers, the KEGG modules can be computationally evaluated revealing metabolic capacities and other phenotypic features. The reaction modules, which represent chemical units of reactions, have been used to analyze design principles of metabolic networks and also to improve the definition of K numbers and associated annotations. For translational bioinformatics, the KEGG MEDICUS resource has been developed by integrating drug labels (package inserts) used in society.},

  volume = {37},
  issn = {0307-0565},
  doi = {10.1038/ijo.2012.191},
  abstract = {Background:
The intake of a Western diet enriched in animal fat has been shown to be a major risk factor for Type 2 diabetes and obesity. Previous rodent studies have indicated that these conditions may be triggered by the accumulation of the sphingolipid ceramide in insulin-sensitive tissues. However, data are lacking in this regard from both humans and non-human primates.

Objective:
Here we have investigated the relationship between plasma ceramides and metabolic syndrome in Rhesus macaques fed a high-fat and high-fructose (HFFD) `western' diet.

Methods:
We investigated this relationship in cohorts of monkeys fed a HFFD for a period of 8 months to 5 years. Animals were classified as control, pre-diabetic or diabetic based on fasting plasma parameters and insulin sensitivity.

Results:
HFFD treatment produced significant increases in body weight and body fat and also resulted in a decline in insulin sensitivity. In parallel to the reduction in insulin sensitivity, significant increases in both plasma ceramide and dihydroceramide levels were observed, which further increased as animals progressed to the diabetic state. Plasma levels of the rare sphingolipid C18:0 deoxysphinganine, a marker of increased metabolic flux through serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), were also elevated in both pre- and diabetic animals. Furthermore, plasma serine levels were significantly elevated in diabetic monkeys, which may indicate a shift in SPT substrate selectivity from serine to alanine or glycine. In contrast, branch chain amino acids were unchanged in pre-diabetic non-human primates, and only plasma valine levels were elevated in diabetic animals.

Conclusion:
Together, these data indicate that HFFD induces de novo synthesis of ceramides in non-human primates, and that increased production of plasma ceramides is significantly correlated with the decline in insulin sensitivity.},

However, emerging evidence points to dramatic complexities in ceramide metabolism and structure that defy the prevailing unifying hypothesis on ceramide function that is based on the understanding of ceramide as a single entity. Here, we develop the concept that ``ceramide'' constitutes a family of closely related molecules, subject to metabolism by $>$28 enzymes and with $>$200 structurally distinct mammalian ceramides distinguished by specific structural modifications. These ceramides are synthesized in a combinatorial fashion with distinct enzymes responsible for the specific modifications. These multiple pathways of ceramide generation led to the hypothesis that individual ceramide molecular species are regulated by specific biochemical pathways in distinct subcellular compartments and execute distinct functions. In this minireview, we describe the ``many ceramides'' paradigm, along with the rationale, supporting evidence, and implications for our understanding of bioactive sphingolipids and approaches for unraveling these pathways.},

  abstract = {The hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus grows optimally above 80 degrees C and utilizes an unusual, promiscuous, non-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway to metabolize both glucose and galactose. The first enzyme in this pathway, glucose dehydrogenase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconate, but has been shown to have activity with a broad range of sugar substrates, including glucose, galactose, xylose, and L-arabinose, with a requirement for the glucose stereo configuration at the C2 and C3 positions. Here we report the crystal structure of the apo form of glucose dehydrogenase to a resolution of 1.8 A and a complex with its required cofactor, NADP+, to a resolution of 2.3 A. A T41A mutation was engineered to enable the trapping of substrate in the crystal. Complexes of the enzyme with D-glucose and D-xylose are presented to resolutions of 1.6 and 1.5 A, respectively, that provide evidence of selectivity for the beta-anomeric, pyranose form of the substrate, and indicate that this is the productive substrate form. The nature of the promiscuity of glucose dehydrogenase is also elucidated, and a physiological role for this enzyme in xylose metabolism is suggested. Finally, the structure suggests that the mechanism of sugar oxidation by this enzyme may be similar to that described for human sorbitol dehydrogenase.},

  issn = {0003-2700},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful molecular imaging technique. In microprobe MSI, images are created through a grid-wise interrogation of individual spots by mass spectrometry across a surface. Classical statistical tests for within-sample comparisons fail as close-by measurement spots violate the assumption of independence of these tests, which can lead to an increased false-discovery rate. For spatial data, this effect is referred to as spatial autocorrelation. In this study, we investigated spatial autocorrelation in three different matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MSI data sets. These data sets cover different molecular classes (metabolites/drugs, lipids, and proteins) and different spatial resolutions ranging from 20 to 100 $\mu$m. Significant spatial autocorrelation was detected in all three data sets and found to increase with decreasing pixel size. To enable statistical testing for differences in mass signal intensities between regions of interest within MSI data sets, we propose the use of Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) models. We show that, by accounting for spatial autocorrelation, discovery rates (i.e., the ratio between the features identified and the total number of features) could be reduced between 21\% and 69\%. The reliability of this approach was validated by control mass signals based on prior knowledge. In light of the advent of larger MSI data sets based on either an increased spatial resolution or 3D data sets, accounting for effects due to spatial autocorrelation becomes even more indispensable. Here, we propose a generic and easily applicable workflow to enable within-sample statistical comparisons.},

  abstract = {In many laser based ionization techniques with a subsequent drift time separation, the laser pulse generating the ions is considered as the start time t0. Therefore, an accurate temporal definition of this event is crucial for the resolution of the experiments. In this contribution, the laser induced plume dynamics of liquids evaporating into atmospheric pressure are visualized for two distinctively different laser pulse widths, $\Delta$t = 6 nanoseconds and $\Delta\tau$ = 280 microseconds. For ns-pulses the expansion of the generated vapour against atmospheric pressure is found to lead to turbulences inside the gas phase. This results in spatial and temporal broadening of the nascent clouds. A more equilibrated expansion, without artificial smearing of the temporal resolution can, in contrast, be observed to follow $\mu$s-pulse excitation. This leads to the counterintuitive finding that longer laser pulses results in an increased temporal vapour formation definition. To examine if this fume expansion also eventually results in a better definition of ion formation, the nascent vapour plumes were expanded into a linear drift tube ion mobility spectrometer (IMS). This time resolved detection of ion formation corroborates the temporal broadening caused by collisional impeding of the supersonic expansion at atmospheric pressure and the overall better defined ion formation by evaporation with long laser pulses. A direct comparison of the observed results strongly suggests the coexistence of two individual ion formation mechanisms that can be specifically addressed by the use of appropriate laser sources.},

  abstract = {The novel combination of infrared matrix-assisted laser dispersion and ionization (IR-MALDI) with ion mobility (IM) spectrometry makes it possible to investigate biomolecules in their natural environment, liquid water. As an alternative to an ESI source, the IR-MALDI source was implemented in an in-house-developed ion mobility (IM) spectrometer. The release of ions directly from an aqueous solution is based on a phase explosion, induced by the absorption of an IR laser pulse ($\lambda$\,=\,2.94~$\mu$m, 6~ns pulse width), which disperses the liquid as nano- and micro-droplets. The prerequisites for the application of IR-MALDI-IM spectrometry as an analytical method are narrow analyte ion signal peaks for a high spectrometer resolution. This can only be achieved by improving the desolvation of ions. One way to full desolvation is to give the cluster ions sufficient time to desolvate. Two methods for achieving this are studied: the implementation of an additional drift tube, as in ESI-IM-spectrometry, and the delayed extraction of the ions. As a result of this optimization procedure, limits of detection between 5 nM and 2.5~$\mu$M as well as linear dynamic ranges of 2\textendash{}3 orders of magnitude were obtained for a number of substances. The ability of this method to analyze simple mixtures is illustrated by the separation of two different surfactant mixtures.},

That renewed method comprises the output of an a Er:YAG laser at lambda = 2.94 mu m which is in resonance with the OH stretch vibration band of solvents like water and alcohols. A temporal pulse width larger than the time needed for pressure redistribution and also above the temperature redistribution time constant was found to lead to soft evaporation/ionization. Despite these mild desorption conditions, no additional postionization is found to be needed. Accordingly, the ionization is found to be very soft resulting in entirely intact analyte ions and concentration dependent cluster ions. Resulting mass spectra of small amino acids and large antibiotics are presented showing the versatility of the introduced technique. Above a critical mass of m approximate to 1 kDa, the formed ions carry multiple charges as it is typical for thermospray or electrospray ionization. The detection technique enables fast contactless analysis of the chemical composition of levitated microreactors and, thus, paves the way for future contactless reaction monitoring.},

  abstract = {Among the large number of new ambient ionization schemes in the last few years, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) has witnessed special attention. In this contribution a versatile dual mode DBD is introduced and characterized by means of optical emission spectroscopy and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A direct comparison of the individual results from spectroscopy, spectrometry and transient current/voltage consumption gives evidence for the existence of two individual operational mechanisms. The first is driven by rapid transient changes in the potential difference between the two electrodes over time (usually denoted as the homogeneous mode), while the second is caused at high static potential differences (leading to filamentary discharges). The transient versus steady-state characteristics of the individual discharge origin suggest the driving force for the current flow to be inductive and capacitive, respectively. In most cases of dielectric barrier plasmas both discharge types coexist as competitive ion formation channels, however, detailed plasma characteristics of DBDs operated under different conditions allow for a clear distinction of the individual contributions. In this way, two characteristic product channels for the ionization of ambient water could be observed resulting in the generation of either preferentially protonated water clusters or ammonium water clusters. Careful tuning of the operation parameters of the discharge device allows an operation predominated by either of the two modes. As a consequence, facile switching into the desired operational mode results in either protonated molecules or ammoniated molecules of the analyte. Plasma characteristics for both moieties were evaluated and cross-correlated on the basis of several factors including: the production of reagent ions, the individual appearance of current/voltage profiles, UV/Vis spectroscopy, voltage and flux dependence and the individual response to test compounds. Although the filamentary mode has been already discussed in the literature to induce fragmentation processes, no experimental evidence for analyte dissociation could be found in the case of the test compounds used.},

Dielectric-barrier discharges, particularly the low-temperature plasma (LTP) probe format, have been at the forefront of this field due to their low power consumption and relatively simple design. However, better fundamental understanding of this desorption/ionization source is needed to improve the analytical capabilities of such a device. Here, we use relatively fast (2.5 ms per spectrum) time-resolved mass spectrometry to characterize the temporal reagent-ion distribution from a low-frequency LTP probe. Different voltage waveforms were found to heavily influence the discharge properties and, consequently, ion production. Ion signals from short discharge pulses, ca. 40 mu s, were found to be significantly broadened, ca. 10 ms, prior to extraction into the mass spectrometer. Additionally, higher frequencies of a sine-wave LTP produced the largest flux of reagent ions, which existed for most of the voltage waveforms. Finally, temporal signals for reagent and analyte ions were measured and related to specific ionization processes: proton transfer and charge transfer.},

  abstract = {One major drawback of matrix-assisted Laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is still the relatively poor pulse-to-pulse reproducibility of the signal intensity. This problem, caused by insufficient homogeneity in the matrix/analyte co-crystallization, is usually circumvented by averaging the detected ion intensity over several shots. However, during the consecutive laser pulses, the applied matrix gets depleted and only a number of subsequent experiments can be done on the same sample spot. In order to achieve the desired long-term stability in combination with a sufficient pulse-to-pulse reproducibility, recently liquid MALDI matrices have been introduced. This contribution demonstrates the promising combination of liquid matrices with high repetition rate lasers for atmospheric pressure MALDI (AP-MALDI). To demonstrate the robustness of the new approach, two different kinds of liquid matrices were used in combination with both a typical flashlamp pumped 15 Hz laser and a diode pumped solid state laser operated at 5 kHz. The latter showed a stable ion signal over more than 3,500,000 consecutive laser pulses.},

  abstract = {In recent years, chemical imaging was prognosticated to become one of the key analytical applications for laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). However, moderate spatial resolution and the associated measurement time required for a larger sampling area, have restricted this versatile, high sensitivity technique from being routinely used in two-dimensional chemical imaging. This work describes the development and investigation of a low dispersion sample chamber (tube cell), which allows improvement of the imaging capabilities by reduction of the single LA shot duration to 30 ms (full width at 1\% maximum). The new tube cell is based on a constant laminar flow and a well-controlled delivery of the laser-ablated aerosol into the transport system, leading to minimized tailing of the aerosol washout and helping to separate the signals even at repetition rates as high as 20-30 Hz. To demonstrate the improved imaging capabilities, microstructured metallic thin film patterns were analyzed at a spatial resolution of a few micrometers. The LA-ICP-MS results obtained were comparable to Synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (SR-microXRF). The suitability of the newly designed cell for multielement acquisitions was demonstrated using a simultaneous ICP-Mattauch-Herzog-MS. Finally, the novel laser ablation cell was applied to image the distribution of a metal-tagged biomarker in a thin section of breast cancer tissue. This application demonstrates that the technique is able to produce subcellular (similar to 1 mu m) spatial resolution, which is crucial for morphological assessment in cancer diagnostics.},

Acquiring and correlating information from complementary imaging experiments has the potential to expose complex chemical behavior in ways that are simply not available from single methods applied in isolation, thereby greatly amplifying the information gathering power of imaging experiments. However, in order to correlate image information across platforms, a number of issues must be addressed. First, signals are obtained from disparate experiments with fundamentally different figures of merit, including pixel size, spatial resolution, dynamic range, and acquisition rates. In addition, images are often acquired on different instruments in different locations, so the sample must be registered spatially so that the same area of the sample landscape is addressed. The signals acquired must be correlated in both spatial and temporal domains, and the resulting information has to be presented in a way that is readily understood. These requirements pose special challenges for image cross-correlation that go well beyond those posed in single technique imaging approaches. The special opportunities and challenges that attend correlated imaging are explored by specific reference to correlated mass spectrometric and Raman imaging, a topic of substantial and growing interest.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE The direct detection of organic molecules by mass spectrometry requires ionization methods which are compatible with ambient conditions. A relatively new strategy is the use of a free low-temperature plasma beam for ionization. The objective is to design a safe and adjustable plasma beam to enable optimal ionization and desorption parameters for specific molecules. METHODS A plasma probe based on a dielectric barrier discharge was designed, where the plasma is guided through an internal second tube. This setup permits different beam diameter settings and the control of the plasma temperature. The ionization and desorption of pure organic compounds, as well as their direct detection from roasted coffee beans, were tested. RESULTS The presented plasma probe provides improved safety with respect to arcing, ozone generation and electric shock, compared with conventional designs. The functionality of previously reported devices is expanded. A defined plasma diameter can be set by choosing the appropriate insert, while the input voltage controls the plasma temperature. The variation of measurement parameters enables the optimized direct detection of target compounds from roasted coffee beans, such as caffeine, guaiacol and vanillin. CONCLUSIONS The presented low-temperature plasma probe allows the fine-tuning of ionization and desorption parameters, according to the target molecules. Possible applications include: (1) The ambient ionization and desorption of organic compounds with different volatility and (2) The direct analysis of food products such as roasted coffee beans.

IR-LAMICI integrates IR laser ablation and direct analysis in real time (DART)-type metastable-induced chemical ionization for open air mass spectrometry (MS) ionization. The ion generation in the IR-LAMICI source is a two step process. First, IR laser pulses impinge the sample surface ablating surface material. Second, a portion of ablated material reacts with the metastable reactive plume facilitating gas-phase chemical ionization of analyte molecules generating protonated or deprotonated species in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. The successful coupling of IR-laser ablation with metastable-induced chemical ionization resulted in an ambient plasma-based spatially resolved small molecule imaging platform for mass spectrometry (MS). The analytical capabilities of IR-LAMICI are explored by imaging pharmaceutical tablets, screening counterfeit drugs, and probing algal tissue surfaces for natural products. The resolution of a chemical image is determined by the crater size produced with each laser pulse but not by the size of the metastable gas jet. The detection limits for an active pharmaceutical ingredient (acetaminophen) using the IR-LAMICI source is calculated to be low picograms. Furthermore, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic simulations showed improvements in the IR-LAMICI ion source are possible.},

Simultaneous identification of diverse molecules is a Virtue of mass spectrometry (MS) that in combination with ambient ion sources enables the atmospheric. pressure investigation of biomolecular distributions and processes. Here, we report on the development of an MS-based technique that allows 3D chemical imaging of tissues under ambient conditions without sample preparation. The method utilizes laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) for direct molecular imaging with lateral and depth resolutions of similar to 300 mu m and 30-40 mu m, respectively. We demonstrate the feasibility of LAESI 3D imaging MS of metabolites in the leaf tissues of Peace lily (Spathiphyllum lynise) and the variegated Zebra plant (Aphelandra squarrosa). Extensive tandem MS studies help with tire structure identification of the metabolites. The 3D distributions are found to exhibit tissue-specific metabolite accumulation patterns that correlate with the biochemical roles of these chemical species in plant defense and photosynthesis. Spatial correlation coefficients between the intensity distributions of different ions help to identify colocalization of metabolites and potentially uncover connections between metabolic pathways.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms of energy deposition in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry with infrared lasers (IR-MALDI-MS) have been evaluated in a series of experiments. In a first part, the threshold fluences for the generation of IR-MALDI spectra were determined between 2.7 and 4.0 mum wavelength with an optical parametric oscillator as a tunable laser source for nine solid state and two liquid matrices of different chemical structure and compared to the infrared absorption spectra of the compounds. Preliminary spectra of IR-MALDI in the wavelength range of 1.45-1.75 mum are also presented using the overtone vibrations of a glycerol matrix. Matrices were chosen with regard to their IR-MALDI performance and to allow conclusions on the IR-absorption mechanisms. Whereas the wavelength dependence of the threshold fluence for non-hydrogen-bound C-H vibrations essentially follows the absorption spectrum of this functional group, strong discrepancies between the spectral dependence of threshold fluences and IR-absorption spectra were found for the vibrations of O-H and N-H groups around 3-mum wavelength that form strong intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. In a second part, experiments are described that interrogate the two most probable mechanisms for the observed deviation of the threshold fluence behavior from the wavelength course of the IR-absorption spectra, that is, absorption by either free or weakened O-H and N-H stretching modes or by residual free water. All investigations were performed with glycerol and succinic acid as examples for common liquid and solid state matrices for IR-MALDI. For glycerol, a fluence-dependent, dynamic change in absorption during the laser pulse was revealed by laser transmission measurements on thin glycerol layers. This effect, characterized by a significant blue shift of the O-H stretch absorption, can be attributed to a weakening of intermolecular hydrogen bonds caused by the transient laser heating of the sample. Taking this effect into account, a good correspondence of the wavelength dependence of the threshold fluence with the infrared absorption under IR-MALDI conditions is derived for glycerol. For succinic acid, in contrast, the identification of the predominant absorption mechanism in the 3-mum wavelength range appears more difficult. A fluence-dependent absorption was not detected in laser transmission experiments with succinic acid single crystals. A change in analyte-to-matrix ratio, with the intention of inducing free absorbers near crystal defects, also did not influence the wavelength dependence of the threshold fluences. However, an influence of the surface-to-volume ratio on the wavelength-dependent threshold fluences was found by a comparison of three different preparation techniques for succinic acid, indicating a putative influence of weakly hydrogen-bound surface absorbers. In combination with the detailed analysis of the wavelength dependence of the threshold fluence given from the first part, a determination of the IR-MALDI process for succinic acid based on the absorption by weakly hydrogen-bound hydroxyl groups is suggested. No evidence for a significant contribution of residual free water absorption to the low-threshold fluences around 3-mum wavelength was found by monitoring a possible change in threshold fluence at the phase transition from water to ice and by reducing the analyte hydration and varying the writer content in glycerol preparations. Also, in preparations with frozen hydrated proteins without organic matrices, the wavelength dependence of the threshold fluence did not reflect the spectral absorption of ice, supporting the assumption of a rather minor role of the absorption by residual water in IR-MALDI.

  abstract = {Deep-sea biogeochemical cycles are, in general, poorly understood owing to the difficulties of making measurements in situ, recovering samples with minimal perturbation, and, in many cases, coping with high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. In particular, biogeochemical fluxes of volatiles such as methane remain largely unconstrained because of the difficulties with accurate quantification in situ and the patchiness of point sources such as seeps and brine pools. To better constrain biogeochemical fluxes and cycling, we have developed a deep-sea in situ mass spectrometer (ISMS) to enable high-resolution quantification of volatiles in situ. Here we report direct measurements of methane concentrations made in a Gulf of Mexico brine pool located at a depth of over 2300 m. Concentrations of up to 33 mM methane were observed within the brine pool, whereas concentrations in the water directly above were three orders of magnitude lower. These direct measurements enabled us to make the first accurate estimates of the diffusive flux from a brine pool, calculated to be 1.1$\pm$0.2 mol m-2 yr-1. Integrated rate measurements of aerobic methane oxidation in the water column overlying the brine pool were $\sim$320 $\mu$mol m-2 yr-1, accounting at most for just 0.03\% of the diffusive methane flux from the brine pool. Calculated rates of anaerobic methane oxidation were 600\textendash{}1200 $\mu$M yr-1, one to two orders of magnitude higher than previously published values of AOM in anoxic fluids. These findings suggest that brine pools are enormous point sources of methane in the deep sea, and may, in aggregate, have a pronounced impact on the global marine methane cycle.},

  abstract = {Ambient desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (ADI-MS) aims to enable direct analysis of gaseous, liquid, and/or solid samples under ambient conditions. In ADI-MS, different types of desorption/ionization sources are classified according to their basic method of operation, namely spray-based, laser-based, or plasma-based. This review discusses many of the plasma-based techniques coupled to mass spectrometry in terms of their current performance in fast qualitative screening and quantitative analysis. Critical aspects, for example sample preparation and introduction, quantification, and matrix effects, are addressed. Furthermore, the applicability of plasma-based sources to portable mass spectrometers and their capabilities in imaging experiments are summarized. The applications discussed are of two types. In one, direct screening is performed without any or with minimal sample pretreatment. Samples with low matrix content are qualitatively analyzed without interferences. The other, more challenging applications, namely samples with high matrix content and most quantitative analysis, typically require sample preparation ranging from simple dilution to extensive multi-step procedures.},

  abstract = {Low-temperature plasmas (LTPs) are attractive sources for atomic and molecular mass spectrometry (MS). In the past, the LTP probe, which was first described by Harper et al., was used successfully for direct molecular mass spectrometric analysis with minimal sample pretreatment in a variety of applications. Unfortunately, the desorption/ionization source itself is commercially not available and custom-built LTP set-ups with varying geometry and operational configurations were utilized in the past. In the present study, a rapid chemometrics approach based on systematic experiments and multivariate data analysis was used to optimize the LTP probe geometry and positioning relative to the atmospheric-pressure inlet of a mass spectrometer. Several parameters were studied including the probe geometry, electrode configuration, quartz tube dimensions, probe positioning and operating conditions. It was found that the plasma-to-MS-inlet distance, the plasma-to-sample-plate distance, and the angle between the latter are very important. Additional effects on the analytical performance were found for the outer electrode width, the positioning of the electrodes, the inner diameter of the quartz tube, the quartz wall thickness, and the gas flow. All experiments were performed using additional heating of the sample to enhance thermal desorption and maximize the signal (T = 150 ??C). After software-assisted optimization, attractive detection limits were achieved (e.g., 1.8 ?? 10-7 mol/L for 4-acetamidothiophenol). Moreover, relative standard deviation (RSD) improved from values of up to 30\% before optimization to $<$15\% RSD after the procedure was completed. This chemometrics approach for method optimization is not limited to LTP-MS and considered to be attractive for other plasma-based instrumentation as well.},

Recently, direct analysis in real time (DART) MS and low-temperature plasma probe (LTP) MS demonstrated potential in direct qualitative pesticide residue screening and quantitative analysis of pesticides in liquid extracts. In the present study, a LTP-HR-MS method for quantitative pesticide residue analysis in fruit extracts was developed and evaluated with respect to the European Union (EU) legislation on pesticides. In particular, this study focused on pesticides in different fruit matrices that were reported to often exceed legal maximum residue levels (MRLs) in Germany in the past (namely acetamiprid, cyprodinil, fenhexamid, and fludioxonil; see report on of the German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety in 2009). After method optimization, pesticides in spiked and unspiked fruit QuEChERS extracts were identified successfully by LTP-Orbitrap-MS via accurate mass measurements ($<$4 ppm). The method is considered useful for MRL verification. Matrix-matched calibration was applied for quantification because it was found that the fruit matrix (still present during extract analysis) has a significant effect on analyte ion abundance. Linear working ranges greater than four orders of magnitude were achieved. Limits of quantification ranged from 0.001 mg kg-1 to 0.07 mg kg-1 (which is significantly below permitted MRLs). Measurement precision was below 15\% and method precision was typically close to 14\% relative standard deviation. Finally, the validated LTP-HR-MS method was tested with unspiked fruit samples bought from a local grocery store. Pesticide residues of cyprodinil and fludioxonil (0.003-0.03 mg kg-1) were readily detected. These results were directly compared to a standard liquid chromatography electrospray HR-MS method and found to be in good agreement. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

  doi = {10.1039/C5AY00810G},
  abstract = {A low-temperature plasma (LTP) probe is a plasma-based technique that permits the direct and rapid ambient ionization and mass analysis of relatively complex samples in their native environment. It belongs to the ambient desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MS) technique, and these features map well against the requirements of food quality and safety testing. In this study, the application of LTP-MS for the rapid screening and detection of pesticides in wines has been evaluated. Aliquots of a sample extract (3 $\mu$L of each solution) were deposited on a heated (120 $^\circ$C) microscope glass slide for LTP-MS analysis. The analytical performance of LTP-MS has been studied for a set of 10 multiclass fungicides selected according to their relevance and presence in actual wine samples. The compounds included in the study were azoxystrobin, carbendazim, dimethomorph, fenhexamid, flusilazol, metalaxyl, penconazole, tebuconazole, imazalil and thiabendazole. Two different approaches were examined: (i) the direct analyses of wines with no prior treatment besides a simple sample dilution, and (ii) the analyses of sample extracts obtained after a thorough sample preparation step using solid-phase extraction with polymeric cartridges. The proposed approach enabled the detection of the pesticides in wine at low concentration levels in the range from 15 $\mu$g L-1 to 300 $\mu$g L-1 (fulfilling maximum residue levels (MRLs) set in EU regulations in all cases) by means of tandem mass spectrometry experiments with an ion trap operated in the positive ionization mode. The qualitative results obtained with actual red wine market samples compared well against the reference method based on liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Various examples shown demonstrate that ambient LTP-MS can be applied for the detection of these chemicals in beverages without sample treatment steps besides dilution.},

As was observed for gas-phase compounds in part 1 of this study, both polar and nonpolar substances can be ionized and detected by mass spectrometry. The parent molecular ion (or its protonated counterpart) is usually the main spectral feature, with little or no fragmentation in evidence. Preliminary quantitative results show that this approach offers very good sensitivity (detection limits in the picogram regime are reported for several test compounds in part 1 of this study) and linear response to the analyte concentration. Examples of the application of this strategy to the analysis of real-world samples, such as the direct analysis of pharmaceutical compounds or foods is provided. The ability of this source to perform spatially resolved analysis is also demonstrated. Preliminary studies of the mechanisms of the reactions involved are described.},

  abstract = {Over the last few years, a method has been developed for obtaining ionization probability curves with essentially monoenergetic electrons. A retarding potential is applied to the electron beam to yield an energy distribution with a sharp low8208energy limit. By varying the retarding potential slightly, a new low8208energy limit of the distribution can be selected. The difference in the ionization produced in the two cases is ionization by those electrons with a small energy spread selected from the original distribution. By pulsing the electrons and ions, it is possible to eliminate the adverse effect of the ion8208drawout field on the electron energy. With this retarding potential difference (RPD) method, a detailed analysis of ionization probability curves is possible. A full description of this method is given in this paper with a discussion of its advantages and limitations. The mass spectrometer used in this series of studies is described, particular attention being given to a description of the ion source.

A proof-of-concept DAPI interface was designed and characterized using a miniature rectilinear ion trap mass spectrometer. The interface consists of a simple capillary directly connecting the atmospheric pressure ion source to the vacuum mass analyzer region; it has no ion optical elements and no differential pumping stages. Gases carrying ionized analytes were pulsed into the mass analyzer for short periods at high flow rates rather than being continuously introduced at lower flow rates; this procedure maximized ion transfer. The use of DAPI provides a simple solution to the problem of coupling an atmospheric pressure ionization source to a miniature instrument with limited pumping capacity. Data were recorded using various atmospheric pressure ionization sources, including electrospray ionization (ESI), nano-ESI, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) sources. The interface was opened briefly for ion introduction during each scan. With the use of the 18 W pumping system of the Mini 10, limits of detection in the low part-per-billion levels were achieved and unit resolution mass spectra were recorded.},

  abstract = {The irrigate district of Usosalda??a, an important agricultural area in Colombia mainly devoted to rice crop production, is subjected to an intensive use of pesticides. Monitoring these compounds is necessary to know the impact of phytosanitary products in the different environmental compartments. In this work, surface water and soil samples from different sites of this area have been analyzed by applying an analytical methodology for large screening based on the use of time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS) hyphenated to liquid chromatography (LC) and gas chromatography (GC). Several pesticides were detected and unequivocally identified, such as the herbicides atrazine, diuron or clomazone. Some of their main metabolites and/or transformation products (TPs) like deethylatrazine (DEA), deisopropylatrazine (DIA) and 3,4-dichloroaniline were also identified in the samples. Among fungicides, carbendazim, azoxystrobin, propiconazole and epoxiconazole were the most frequently detected. Insecticides such as thiacloprid, or p,p'-DDT metabolites (p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE) were also found. Thanks to the accurate-mass full-spectrum acquisition in TOF MS it was feasible to widen the number of compounds to be investigated to other families of contaminants. This allowed the detection of emerging contaminants, such as the antioxidant 3,5-di-tertbutyl-4-hydroxy-toluene (BHT), its metabolite 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-benzaldehyde (BHT-CHO), or the solar filter benzophenone, among others. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Plasma-based ambient desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (ADI-MS) has attracted considerable attention in many fields because of its capacity for direct sample analyses. In this study, a high-power pulsed microplasma jet (HPPMJ) was developed and investigated as a new plasma desorption/ionization source. In an HPPMJ, a microhollow cathode discharge is generated in a small hole (500\,$\mathrm{\mu}$m in diameter) using a pulsed high-power supply. This system can realize a maximum power density of 5\,\texttimes\,10(8) W/cm(3). The measured electron number density, excitation temperature and afterglow gas temperature of the HPPMJ were 3.7\,\texttimes\,10(15) cm(-3), 7000\,K at maximum and less than 60\,$^\circ$C, respectively, which demonstrate that the HPPMJ is a high-energy, high-density plasma source that is comparable with an argon inductively coupled plasma while maintaining a low gas temperature. The HPPMJ causes no observable damage to the target because of its low gas temperature and electrode configuration; thus, we can apply it directly to human skin. To demonstrate the analytical capacity of ADI-MS using an HPPMJ, the plasma was applied to direct solid sample analysis of the active ingredients in pharmaceutical tablets. Caffeine, acetaminophen, ethenzamide, isopropylantipyrine and ibuprofen were successfully detected. Application to living tissue was also demonstrated, and isopropylantipyrine on a finger was successfully analyzed without damaging the skin. The limits of detection (LODs) for caffeine, isopropylantipyrine and ethenzamide were calculated, and LODs at the picogram level were achieved. These results indicate the applicability of the HPPMJ for high-sensitivity analysis of materials on a heat-sensitive surface.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is of high and growing interest in life science research, but the investment for necessary equipment is often prohibitive for small research groups. Therefore, we developed a basic MSI system from low cost 'Plug and Play' components, which are connected to the Universal Serial Bus (USB) of a standard computer. Our open source software OpenMZxy (http://www.bioprocess.org/openmzxy) enables automatic and manual sampling, as well as the recording of position data. For ionization we used a low-temperature plasma probe (LTP), coupled to a quadrupole mass analyzer. The current set-up has a practical resolution of 1mm, and a sampling area of 100\texttimes{}100mm, resulting in up to 10,000 sampling points. Our prototype is easy and economical to adopt for different types of mass analyzers. We prove the usability of the LTP-MSI system for macroscopic samples by imaging the distribution of metabolites in the longitudinal cross-cut of a chili (Capsicum annuum, 'Jalape{\~n}o pepper') fruit. The localization of capsaicin in the placenta could be confirmed. But additionally, yet unknown low molecular weight compounds were detected in defined areas, which underline the potential of LTP-MSI for the imaging of volatile and semi-volatile metabolites and for the discovery of new natural products. Biological significance Knowledge about the spatial distribution of metabolites, proteins, or lipids in a given tissue often leads to novel findings in medicine and biology. Therefore, mass spectrometry based imaging (MSI) is becoming increasingly popular in life science research. However, the investment for necessary equipment is often prohibitive for small research groups. We built a prototype with an ambient ionization source, which is easy and economical to adopt for different types of mass analyzers.

Two such ionization methods, low temperature plasma (LTP) and paper spray (PS), were employed in experiments performed at a local grocery store. LTP was used to detect diphenylamine (DPA) directly from the skin of apples in the store and those treated after harvest with DPA were recognized by MS and MS/MS. These data therefore allowed ready distinction between organic and non-organic apples. DPA was also found within the internal tissue of purchased apples and its distribution was mapped using LTP. Similarly, thiabendazole residues were detected on the skin of treated oranges in a grocery store experiment in which paper spray was performed by wiping the orange surface with a moist commercial lens wipe and then applying a high voltage to ionize the chemicals directly from the wipe. The handheld mass spectrometer used in these measurements is capable of performing several stages of tandem mass spectrometry (up to MS(5)); the compounds on the fruit were identified by their MS/MS fragmentation patterns. Protonated DPA (m/z 170) produced a characteristic MS(2) fragment ion at m/z 92, while thiabendazole was identified by MS(3) using precursor to fragment ion transitions m/z 202 $\rightarrow$m/z 175 $\rightarrow$m/z 131.

The discharge generates ozone from air which reacts with and cleaves olefins. The molecular ions of the resulting acid/ester oxidation products are present in the full scan mass spectra, and are confirmed by exact mass measurements. The fragmentation information can be used to assign double bond positions. We have successfully applied this strategy to a range of mono/polyunsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid methyl/ethyl esters to assign their double bond locations. The procedure allows rapid and direct identification of double bond positions in situ at atmospheric pressure without sample preparation prior to mass spectrometric analysis. Microbial fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) mixtures from complex bacterial samples were directly analyzed by this method. Structural confirmation of their diagnostic ions by using exact mass measurements and tandem mass spectrometry confirms double bond positions in unsaturated bacterial FAEEs.},

Key monomeric oxidation products including levulinic acid, 4-acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene, limonene oxide, 3-isopropenyl-6-oxo-heptanal, and the secondary ozonide of limonene could be identified by collision-induced dissociation. Oligomeric products ranged from the nonoxidized dimer of limonene (C20H30) and up to the hexamer with 10 oxygen atoms (C60H90O10).

The 1083 nm light allows for efficient loading of a large magneto-optical trap (MOT) and the 389 nm light is subsequently used to increase the density and reduce the temperature of the He* cloud during a brief compression stage. Cold collisions in the cloud yield ions and fast metastables which are monitored separately using calibrated microchannel plate (MCP) detectors. We thus measure absolute production rates of ions and fast metastables escaping from the MOT during the various stages of the experiment. We observe that 389 nm optical collisions, apart from Penning ionization, produce a relatively large flux of fast metastables, which we relate to the short-range behaviour of the molecular potentials involved. Furthermore, by rapidly switching between 389 nm and 1083 nm the ratio between the respective two-body loss rate constants is determined. Using these values, together with the observed time dependence of the cloud size, the temporal behaviour of the absolute ion production rate during the compression stage is well reproduced.},

Processes inherent to the glow discharge, namely cathodic sputtering coupled with Penning ionization, yield an ion population from which semi-quantitative results can be directly obtained. Quantification in GDMS is achieved both through standard elemental mass spectrometric procedures and more innovative approaches. The analytical performance of GDMS compares favorably with competing elemental mass spectrometric methods and newer experiments use this ionization method for both molecular and elemental analysis. As with any analytical technique, the future of GDMS lies in improvements with respect to instrumental implementation and extension to new areas of application. If the method is to remain competitive, commercial GDMS systems must incorporate advances in mass spectrometric technology to increase analytical performance while decreasing the size, complexity and cost of the technique. Continued efforts to develop improved quantitation procedures are needed to provide greater accuracy. The method should continue to mature as sustained efforts demonstrate its utility in the solution of new and more varied problems.},

The surrounding atmosphere of the jet is varied from pure oxygen to pure nitrogen with a gas shielding device. The highest metastable density of 1.3 \texttimes{} 10 13 cm -3 is obtained in the center of the jet close to the nozzle exit at normal atmospheric air conditions. Within 0.3 mm in the radial direction and 2 mm in the axial direction, the He metastable density drops below the detection limit. The obtained He metastable lifetime is almost independent of the shielding gas composition. By analyzing the diffusion of shielding gas species into the effluent it is concluded that their density is too low to explain the observed He metastable lifetime. Instead, impurities from the feed gas, especially water molecules, are more likely to be responsible. However, a drastic change in metastable He density is observed when decreasing the amount of oxygen in the shielding gas. The lower the oxygen amount, the lower the metastable He density. For pure nitrogen, no He metastables are detected at all. By exchanging nitrogen with argon, a similar behavior is observed. Thus, it is concluded that it is the absence of ambient oxygen rather than the elevated presence of nitrogen, which is responsible for the observed decrease in the He (2 3 S 1 ) density.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Structural Engineering practice has started adopting performance-based building design, a concept that produces a more resilient structural design as it accounts for the probabilistic nature of natural hazards such as earthquakes. Often times, a large number of dynamic building simulations have to be explored, producing results datasets that might typically be tens or hundreds of gigabytes. It is imperative to manage these datasets efficiently, to enable engineers run a larger number of simulations which helps produce more robust designs. Hierarchal Data Format (HDF) is a scientific data management library\textemdash{}to allow storing large amounts of data in hierarchal form on different platforms. SQLite is a relational database library based on the SQL language that can manage data efficiently on the local disk, without a server. In this study, the two libraries (HDF and SQLite) are explored for efficient dataset management, by comparing their efficiency using different performance metrics for storing and retrieving data in different scenarios. Two reading performance metrics were then considered, one based on data being read directly from disk (cold cache), and another for data being cached in memory (warm cache). Based on different building design simulations, performances of both libraries are compared for writing and reading with both warm and cold cache. According to the comparative study, it is concluded that the HDF library is faster in storing and retrieving big chunks of data and also required less storage space. Although the study was performed on structural simulation datasets, the conclusions are likely applicable to different kinds of datasets often encountered in many different engineering disciplines.},

  abstract = {Low-temperature plasma (LTP) ionization represents an emerging technology in ambient mass spectrometry. LTP enables the solvent-free direct detection of a broad range of molecules and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). The low energy consumption and modest technical requirements of these ion sources favors their employment in mobile applications and as a means to upgrade existing mass analyzers. However, the broad adoption of LTP is hindered by the lack of commercial devices, and constructing personal devices is tricky. Improper setup can result in equipment malfunction or may cause serious damage to instruments due to strong electromagnetic fields or arcing. With this in mind, we developed a reproducible LTP probe, which is designed exclusively from commercial and 3D printed components. The plasma jet generated by the device has a diameter of about 200 $\mu$m, which is satisfactory for the ambient imaging of macroscopic samples. We coupled the 3D-LTP probe to an ion trap analyzer and demonstrated the functionality of the ion source by detecting organic and chemical compounds from pure reference standards, biological substances, and pharmaceutical samples. Molecules were primarily detected in their protonated form or as water/ammonium adducts. The identification of compounds was possible by standard collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation spectra. The files necessary to reproduce the 3D parts are available from the project page ( http://lababi.bioprocess.org/index.php/3d-ltp ) under a dual license model, which permits reproduction of the probe and further community-driven development for noncommercial use ("peer production"). Our reproducible probe design thus contributes to a facilitated adaption and evolution of low-temperature plasma technologies in analytical chemistry.},

  abstract = {Desorption nanoelectrospray (nanoDESI) was described in 2007 and it represents a miniaturized version of desorption electrospray without the assistance of the nebulizing gas. Compared to DESI, a nanoelectrospray tip (2 $\pm$ 1 $\mu$m I.D.) generates primary charged droplets of smaller sizes and lower spray liquid flow rates. This is the first report on utilization of nanoDESI for mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Its new coupling with a Q-TOF instrument allowed faster mass spectra acquisition (4 Hz) essential for MSI of fine surface details. To evaluate nanoDESI potential for mass spectrometry imaging, etched glass substrates with Rhodamine B patterns of different dimensions were prepared. The Rhodamine B lines were analysed in 1D scanning mode and their width was determined experimentally by nanoDESI measurement. The experimental data revealed that the lateral resolution of nanoDESI is close to 30 $\mu$m along the x-axis (orthogonal to the inlet). 2D scanning mode confirmed good resolution along both axes as dye squares with dimensions about 60 $\mu$m \texttimes{} 60 $\mu$m were easily distinguished. The low flow rate of the spray liquid reduced undesirable analyte washing effects, which allowed repeated scanning analysis of the surface. The presented results demonstrate the applicability of nanoDESI for high surface resolution mass spectrometry imaging.},

  abstract = {In 1865, Gregor Mendel presented ``Experiments in Plant-Hybridization,'' the results of his eight-year study of the principles of inheritance through experimentation with pea plants. Overlooked in its day, Mendel's work would later become the foundation of modern genetics. Did his pioneering research follow the rigors of real scientific inquiry, or was Mendel's data too good to be true-the product of doctored statistics?~In Ending the Mendel-Fisher Controversy, leading experts present their conclusions on the legendary controversy surrounding the challenge to Mendel's findings by British statistician and biologist R. A. Fisher. In his 1936 paper ``Has Mendel's Work Been Rediscovered?'' Fisher suggested that Mendel's data could have been falsified in order to support his expectations. Fisher attributed the falsification to an unknown assistant of Mendel's. At the time, Fisher's criticism did not receive wide attention. Yet beginning in 1964, about the time of the centenary of Mendel's paper, scholars began to publicly discuss whether Fisher had successfully proven that Mendel's data was falsified. Since that time, numerous articles, letters, and comments have been published on the controversy.This self-contained volume includes everything the reader will need to know about the subject: an overview of the controversy; the original papers of Mendel and Fisher; four of the most important papers on the debate; and new updates, by the authors, of the latter four papers. Taken together, the authors contend, these voices argue for an end to the controversy-making this book the definitive last word on the subject.},

Around the world, celebrations of the monk whose work with pea varieties made him the father of genetics are under way. Mendel has alas acquired another, less auspicious title, as ``the father of scientific misconduct,'' owing to suspicions that he faked some of his data (2). The suspicions have turned out to be groundless (3, 4). Along the way, however, they not only damaged Mendel's reputation unfairly but, as a look at the history of the controversy shows, sent critical discussion of his data down a sidetrack.

Based on a review of existing community practices, the goal of the working group was to produce a consolidated set of citation principles that may encourage broad adoption of a consistent policy for software citation across disciplines and venues. Our work is presented here as a set of software citation principles, a discussion of the motivations for developing the principles, reviews of existing community practice, and a discussion of the requirements these principles would place upon different stakeholders. Working examples and possible technical solutions for how these principles can be implemented will be discussed in a separate paper.},
